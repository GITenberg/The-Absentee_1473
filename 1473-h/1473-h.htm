    <h2>
      NOTES ON 'THE ABSENTEE'
    </h2>
    <p>
      In August 1811, we are told, she wrote a little play about landlords and
      tenants for the children of her sister, Mrs. Beddoes. Mr. Edgeworth tried
      to get the play produced on the London boards. Writing to her aunt, Mrs.
      Ruxton, Maria says, 'Sheridan has answered as I foresaw he must, that in
      the present state of this country the Lord Chamberlain would not license
      THE ABSENTEE; besides there would be a difficulty in finding actors for so
      many Irish characters.' The little drama was then turned into a story, by
      Mr. Edgeworth's advice. Patronage was laid aside for the moment, and THE
      ABSENTEE appeared in its place in the second part of TALES OF FASHIONABLE
      LIFE. We all know Lord Macaulay's verdict upon this favourite story of
      his, the last scene of which he specially admired and compared to the
      ODYSSEY. [Lord Macaulay was not the only notable admirer of THE ABSENTEE.
      The present writer remembers hearing Professor Ruskin on one occasion
      break out in praise and admiration of the book. 'You can learn more by
      reading it of Irish politics,' he said, 'than from a thousand columns out
      of blue-books.'] Mrs. Edgeworth tells us that much of it was written while
      Maria was suffering a misery of toothache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Edgeworth's own letters all about this time are much more concerned
      with sociabilities than with literature. We read of a pleasant dance at
      Mrs. Burke's; of philosophers at sport in Connemara; of cribbage, and
      company, and country houses, and Lord Longford's merry anecdotes during
      her visit to him. Miss Edgeworth, who scarcely mentions her own works,
      seems much interested at this time in a book called MARY AND HER CAT,
      which she is reading with some of the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little scraps of news (I cannot resist quoting one or two of them) come in
      oddly mixed with these personal records of work and family talk. 'There is
      news of the Empress (Marie Louise), who is liked not at all by the
      Parisians; she is too haughty, and sits back in her carriage when she goes
      through the streets. 'Of Josephine, who is living very happily, amusing
      herself with her gardens and her shrubberies.' This ci-devant Empress and
      Kennedy and Co., the seedsmen, are in partnership, says Miss Edgeworth.
      And then among the lists of all the grand people Maria meets in London in
      1813 (Madame de Stael is mentioned as expected), she gives an interesting
      account of an actual visitor, Peggy Langan, who was grand-daughter to
      Thady in CASTLE RACKRENT. Peggy went to England with Mrs. Beddoes, and was
      for thirty years in the service of Mrs. Haldimand we are told, and was own
      sister to Simple Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of THE ABSENTEE is a very simple one, and concerns Irish
      landlords living in England, who ignore their natural duties and station
      in life, and whose chief ambition is to take their place in the English
      fashionable world. The grand English ladies are talking of Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"If you knew all she endures to look, speak, move, breathe like an
      Englishwoman, you would pity her,"' said Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes, and you CAWNT conceive the PEENS she TEEKES to talk of the TEEBLES
      and CHEERS, and to thank Q, and, with so much TEESTE, to speak pure
      English,"' said Mrs. Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Pure cockney, you mean," said Lady Langdale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, the son of the lady in question, here walks across the
      room, not wishing to listen to any more strictures upon his mother. He is
      the very most charming of walking gentlemen, and when stung by conscience
      he goes off to Ireland, disguised in a big cloak, to visit his father's
      tenantry and to judge for himself of the state of affairs, all our
      sympathies go with him. On his way he stops at Tusculum, scarcely less
      well known than its classical namesake. He is entertained by Mrs.
      Raffarty, that esthetical lady who is determined to have a little 'taste'
      of everything at Tusculum. She leads the way into a little conservatory,
      and a little pinery, and a little grapery, and a little aviary, and a
      little pheasantry, and a little dairy for show, and a little cottage for
      ditto, with a grotto full of shells, and a little hermitage full of
      earwigs, and a little ruin full of looking-glass, to enlarge and multiply
      the effect of the Gothic.... But you could only put your head in, because
      it was just fresh painted, and though there had been a fire ordered in the
      ruin all night, it had only smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As they proceeded and walked through the grounds, from which Mrs.
      Raffarty, though she had done her best, could not take that which nature
      had given, she pointed out to my lord "a happy moving termination,"
      consisting of a Chinese bridge, with a fisherman leaning over the rails.
      On a sudden, the fisherman was seen to tumble over the bridge into the
      water. The gentlemen ran to extricate the poor fellow, while they heard
      Mrs. Raffarty bawling to his lordship to beg he would never mind, and not
      trouble himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When they arrived at the bridge, they saw the man hanging from part of
      the bridge, and apparently struggling in the water; but when they
      attempted to pull him up, they found it was only a stuffed figure which
      had been pulled into the stream by a real fish, which had seized hold of
      the bait.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-party is too long to quote, but it is written in Miss
      Edgeworth's most racy and delightful vein of fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more little fact should not be omitted in any mention of THE ABSENTEE.
      One of the heroines is Miss Broadhurst, the heiress. The Edgeworth family
      were much interested, soon after the book appeared, to hear that a real
      living Miss Broadhurst, an heiress, had appeared upon the scenes, and was,
      moreover, engaged to be married to Sneyd Edgeworth, one of the eldest sons
      of the family. In the story, says Mrs. Edgeworth, Miss Broadhurst selects
      from her lovers one who 'unites worth and wit,' and then she goes on to
      quote an old epigram of Mr. Edgeworth's on himself, which concluded
      with,'There's an Edge to his wit and there's worth in his heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Edgeworth, who was as usual busy building church spires for himself
      and other people, abandoned his engineering for a time to criticise his
      daughter's story, and he advised that the conclusion of THE ABSENTEE
      should be a letter from Larry the postilion. 'He wrote one, she wrote
      another,' says Mrs. Edgeworth. 'He much preferred hers, which is the
      admirable finale of THE ABSENTEE.' And just about this time Lord Ross is
      applied to, to frank the Edgeworth manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot by any form of words express how delighted I am that you are
      none of you angry with me,' writes modest Maria to her cousin, Miss
      Ruxton, 'and that my uncle and aunt are pleased with what they have read
      of THE ABSENTEE. I long to hear whether their favour continues to the end,
      and extends to the catastrophe, that dangerous rock upon which poor
      authors are wrecked.'

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Are you to be at Lady Clonbrony's gala next week?' said Lady Langdale to
      Mrs. Dareville, whilst they were waiting for their carriages in the
      crush-room of the opera house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes! everybody's to be there, I hear,' replied Mrs. Dareville. 'Your
      ladyship, of course?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I don't know&#8212;if I possibly can. Lady Clonbrony makes it such a
      point with me, that I believe I must look in upon her for a few minutes.
      They are going to a prodigious expense on this occasion. Soho tells me the
      reception rooms are all to be new furnished, and in the most magnificent
      style.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At what a famous rate those Clonbronies are dashing on,' said Colonel
      Heathcock. 'Up to anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who are they?&#8212;these Clonbronies, that one hears of so much of late'
      said her Grace of Torcaster. 'Irish absentees I know. But how do they
      support all this enormous expense?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The son WILL have a prodigiously fine estate when some Mr. Quin dies,'
      said Mrs. Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, everybody who comes from Ireland WILL have a fine estate when
      somebody dies,' said her grace. 'But what have they at present?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twenty thousand a year, they say,' replied Mrs. Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ten thousand, I believe,' cried Lady Langdale. 'Make it a rule, you know,
      to believe only half the world says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ten thousand, have they?&#8212;possibly,' said her grace. 'I know nothing
      about them&#8212;have no acquaintance among the Irish. Torcaster knows
      something of Lady Clonbrony; she has fastened herself, by some means, upon
      him: but I charge him not to COMMIT me. Positively, I could not for
      anybody&#8212;and much less for that sort of person&#8212;extend the
      circle of my acquaintance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now that is so cruel of your grace,' said Mrs. Dareville, laughing, 'when
      poor Lady Clonbrony works so hard, and pays so high, to get into certain
      circles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you knew all she endures, to look, speak, move, breathe like an
      Englishwoman, you would pity her,' said Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and you CAWNT conceive the PEENS she TEEKES to talk of the TEEBLES
      and CHEERS, and to thank Q, and, with so much TEESTE, to speak pure
      English,' said Mrs. Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pure cockney, you mean,' said Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why does Lady Clonbrony want to pass for English?' said the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! because she is not quite Irish. BRED AND BORN&#8212;only bred, not
      born,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'And she could not be five minutes in your
      grace's company before she would tell you, that she was HENGLISH, born in
      HOXFORDSHIRE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must be a vastly amusing personage. I should like to meet her, if one
      could see and hear her incog.,' said the duchess. 'And Lord Clonbrony,
      what is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, nobody,' said Mrs. Dareville; 'one never even hears of him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A tribe of daughters, too, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' said Lady Langdale, 'daughters would be past all endurance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a cousin, though, a Grace Nugent,' said Mrs. Dareville, 'that
      Lady Clonbrony has with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Best part of her, too,' said Colonel Heathcock; 'd-d fine girl!&#8212;never
      saw her look better than at the opera to-night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fine COMPLEXION! as Lady Clonbrony says, when she means a high colour,'
      said Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace Nugent is not a lady's beauty,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'Has she any
      fortune, colonel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon honour, don't know,' said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a son, somewhere, is not there?' said Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know, 'pon honour,' replied the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&#8212;at Cambridge&#8212;not of age yet,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'Bless
      me! here is Lady Clonbrony come back. I thought she was gone half an hour
      ago!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mamma,' whispered one of Lady Langdale's daughters, leaning between her
      mother and Mrs. Dareville, 'who is that gentleman that passed us just
      now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Towards the door. There now, mamma, you can see him. He is speaking to
      Lady Clonbrony&#8212;to Miss Nugent. Now Lady Clonbrony is introducing him
      to Miss Broadhurst.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see him now,' said Lady Langdale, examining him through her glass; 'a
      very gentlemanlike-looking young man, indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not an Irishman, I am sure, by his manner,' said her grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heathcock!' said Lady Langdale, 'who is Miss Broadhurst talking to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh! now really&#8212;'pon honour&#8212;don't know,' replied Heathcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And yet he certainly looks like somebody one certainly should know,'
      pursued Lady Langdale, 'though I don't recollect seeing him anywhere
      before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really now!' was all the satisfaction she could gain from the insensible,
      immovable colonel. However, her ladyship, after sending a whisper along
      the line, gained the desired information, that the young gentleman was
      Lord Colambre, son, only son, of Lord and Lady Clonbrony&#8212;that he was
      just come from Cambridge&#8212;that he was not yet of age&#8212;that he
      would be of age within a year&#8212;that he would then, after the death of
      somebody, come into possession of a fine estate, by the mother's side 'and
      therefore, Cat'rine, my dear,' said she, turning round to the daughter,
      who had first pointed him out, 'you understand, we should never talk about
      other people's affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, mamma, never. I hope to goodness, mamma, Lord Colambre did not hear
      what you and Mrs. Dareville were saying!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How could he, child? He was quite at the other end of the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, ma'am, he was at my elbow, close behind us; but I
      never thought about him till I heard somebody say, "My lord&#8212;"'

    <p>
      'Good heavens! I hope he didn't hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, for my part, I said nothing,' cried Lady Langdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And for my part, I said nothing but what everybody knows!' cried Mrs.
      Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And for my part, I am guilty only of hearing,' said the duchess. 'Do,
      pray, Colonel Heathcock, have the goodness to see what my people are
      about, and what chance we have of getting away to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage stops the way!'&#8212;a joyful sound
      to Colonel Heathcock and to her grace, and not less agreeable, at this
      instant, to Lady Langdale, who, the moment she was disembarrassed of the
      duchess, pressed through the crowd to Lady Clonbrony, and, addressing her
      with smiles and complacency, was 'charmed to have a little moment to speak
      to her&#8212;could NOT sooner get through the crowd&#8212;would certainly
      do herself the honour to be at her ladyship's gala on Wednesday.' While
      Lady Langdale spoke, she never seemed to see or think of anybody but Lady
      Clonbrony, though, all the time, she was intent upon every motion of Lord
      Colambre, and, whilst she was obliged to listen with a face of sympathy to
      a long complaint of Lady Clonbrony's, about Mr. Soho's want of taste in
      ottomans, she was vexed to perceive that his lordship showed no desire to
      be introduced to her, or to her daughters; but, on the contrary, was
      standing talking to Miss Nugent. His mother, at the end of her speech,
      looked round for Colambre called him twice before he heard&#8212;introduced
      him to Lady Langdale, and to Lady Cat'rine, and Lady Anne&#8212;, and to
      Mrs. Dareville; to all of whom he bowed with an air of proud coldness,
      which gave them reason to regret that their remarks upon his mother and
      his family had not been made SOTTO VOCE.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady Langdale's carriage stops the way!' Lord Colambre made no offer of
      his services, notwithstanding a look from his mother. Incapable of the
      meanness of voluntarily listening to a conversation not intended for him
      to hear, he had, however, been compelled, by the pressure of the crowd, to
      remain a few minutes stationary, where he could not avoid hearing the
      remarks of the fashionable friends. Disdaining dissimulation, he made no
      attempt to conceal his displeasure. Perhaps his vexation was increased by
      his consciousness that there was some mixture of truth in their sarcasms.
      He was sensible that his mother, in some points&#8212;her manners, for
      instance&#8212;was oblivious to ridicule and satire. In Lady Clonbrony's
      address there was a mixture of constraint, affectation, and indecision,
      unusual in a person of her birth, rank, and knowledge of the world. A
      natural and unnatural manner seemed struggling in all her gestures, and in
      every syllable that she articulated&#8212;a naturally free, familiar,
      good-natured, precipitate, Irish manner, had been schooled, and schooled
      late in life, into a sober, cold, still, stiff deportment, which she
      mistook for English. A strong, Hibernian accent, she had, with infinite
      difficulty, changed into an English tone. Mistaking reverse of wrong for
      right, she caricatured the English pronunciation; and the extraordinary
      precision of her London phraseology betrayed her not to be a Londoner, as
      the man, who strove to pass for an Athenian, was detected by his Attic
      dialect. Not aware of her real danger, Lady Clonbrony was, on the opposite
      side, in continual apprehension, every time she opened her lips, lest some
      treacherous A or E, some strong R, some puzzling aspirate, or
      non-aspirate, some unguarded note, interrogative or expostulatory, should
      betray her to be an Irishwoman. Mrs. Dareville had, in her mimickry,
      perhaps a little exaggerated as to the TEEBLES and CHEERS, but still the
      general likeness of the representation of Lady Clonbrony was strong enough
      to strike and vex her son. He had now, for the first time, an opportunity
      of judging of the estimation in which his mother and his family were held
      by certain leaders of the ton, of whom, in her letters, she had spoken so
      much, and into whose society, or rather into whose parties, she had been
      admitted. He saw that the renegade cowardice, with which she denied,
      abjured, and reviled her own country, gained nothing but ridicule and
      contempt. He loved his mother; and, whilst he endeavoured to conceal her
      faults and foibles as much as possible from his own heart, he could not
      endure those who dragged them to light and ridicule. The next morning the
      first thing that occurred to Lord Colambre's remembrance when he awoke was
      the sound of the contemptuous emphasis which had been laid on the words
      IRISH ABSENTEES! This led to recollections of his native country, to
      comparisons of past and present scenes, to future plans of life. Young and
      careless as he seemed, Lord Colambre was capable of serious reflection. Of
      naturally quick and strong capacity, ardent affections, impetuous temper,
      the early years of his childhood passed at his father's castle in Ireland,
      where, from the lowest servant to the well-dressed dependant of the
      family, everybody had conspired to wait upon, to fondle, to flatter, to
      worship, this darling of their lord. Yet he was not spoiled&#8212;not
      rendered selfish. For, in the midst of this flattery and servility, some
      strokes of genuine generous affection had gone home to his little heart;
      and, though unqualified submission had increased the natural impetuosity
      of his temper, and though visions of his future grandeur had touched his
      infant thought, yet, fortunately, before he acquired any fixed habits of
      insolence or tyranny, he was carried far away from all that were bound or
      willing to submit to his commands, far away from all signs of hereditary
      grandeur&#8212;plunged into one of our great public schools&#8212;into a
      new world. Forced to struggle, mind and body, with his equals, his rivals,
      the little lord became a spirited schoolboy, and, in time, a man.
      Fortunately for him, science and literature happened to be the fashion
      among a set of clever young men with whom he was at Cambridge. His
      ambition for intellectual superiority was raised, his views were enlarged,
      his tastes and his manners formed. The sobriety of English good sense
      mixed most advantageously with Irish vivacity; English prudence governed,
      but did not extinguish his Irish enthusiasm. But, in fact, English and
      Irish had not been invidiously contrasted in his mind: he had been so long
      resident in England, and so intimately connected with Englishmen, that he
      was not oblivious to any of the commonplace ridicule thrown upon
      Hibernians; and he had lived with men who were too well informed and
      liberal to misjudge or depreciate a sister country. He had found, from
      experience, that, however reserved the English may be in manner, they are
      warm at heart; that, however averse they may be from forming new
      acquaintance, their esteem and confidence once gained, they make the most
      solid friends. He had formed friendships in England; he was fully sensible
      of the superior comforts, refinement, and information, of English society;
      but his own country was endeared to him by early association, and a sense
      of duty and patriotism attached him to Ireland. And shall I too be an
      absentee? was a question which resulted from these reflections&#8212;a
      question which he was not yet prepared to answer decidedly. In the
      meantime, the first business of the morning was to execute a commission
      for a Cambridge friend. Mr. Berryl had bought from Mr. Mordicai, a famous
      London coachmaker, a curricle, WARRANTED SOUND, for which he had paid a
      sound price, upon express condition that Mr. Mordicai, BARRING ACCIDENTS,
      should be answerable for all repairs of the curricle for six months. In
      three, both the carriage and body were found to be good for nothing&#8212;the
      curricle had been returned to Mr. Mordicai&#8212;nothing had since been
      heard of it, or from him&#8212;and Lord Colambre had undertaken to pay him
      and it a visit, and to make all proper inquiries. Accordingly, he went to
      the coachmaker's, and, obtaining no satisfaction from the underlings,
      desired to see the head of the house. He was answered, that Mr. Mordicai
      was not at home. His lordship had never seen Mr. Mordicai; but, just then,
      he saw, walking across the yard, a man, who looked something like a Bond
      Street coxcomb, but not the least like a gentleman, who called, in the
      tone of a master, for 'Mr. Mordicai's barouche!' It appeared; and he was
      stepping into it when Lord Colambre took the liberty of stopping him; and,
      pointing to the wreck of Mr. Berryl's curricle, now standing in the yard,
      began a statement of his friend's grievances, and an appeal to common
      justice and conscience, which he, unknowing the nature of the man with
      whom he had to deal, imagined must be irresistible. Mr. Mordicai stood
      without moving a muscle of his dark wooden face. Indeed, in his face there
      appeared to be no muscles, or none which could move; so that, though he
      had what are generally called handsome features, there was, all together,
      something unnatural and shocking in his countenance. When, at last, his
      eyes turned, and his lips opened, this seemed to be done by machinery, and
      not by the will of a living creature, or from the impulse of a rational
      soul. Lord Colambre was so much struck with this strange physiognomy, that
      he actually forgot much he had to say of springs and wheels. But it was no
      matter. Whatever he had said, it would have come to the same thing; and
      Mordicai would have answered as he now did&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir, it was my partner made that bargain, not myself; and I don't hold
      myself bound by it, for he is the sleeping-partner only, and not empowered
      to act in the way of business. Had Mr. Berryl bargained with me, I should
      have told him that he should have looked to these things before his
      carriage went out of our yard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignation of Lord Colambre kindled at these words&#8212;but in vain.
      To all that indignation could by word or look urge against Mordicai, he
      replied&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe so, sir; the law is open to your friend&#8212;the law is open to
      all men who can pay for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre turned in despair from the callous coach-maker, and listened
      to one of his more compassionate-looking workmen, who was reviewing the
      disabled curricle; and, whilst he was waiting to know the sum of his
      friend's misfortune, a fat, jolly, Falstaff looking personage came into
      the yard, accosted Mordicai with a degree of familiarity, which, from a
      gentleman, appeared to Lord Colambre to be almost impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, Mordicai, my good fellow?' cried he, speaking with a strong
      Irish accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is this?' whispered Lord Colambre to the foreman, who was examining
      the curricle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir Terence O'Fay, sir. There must be entire new wheels.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now tell me, my tight fellow,' continued Sir Terence, holding Mordicai
      fast, 'when, in the name of all the saints, good or bad, in the calendar,
      do you reckon to let us sport the SUICIDE?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai forcibly drew his mouth into what he meant for a smile, and
      answered, 'As soon as possible, Sir Terence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence, in a tone of jocose, wheedling expostulation, entreated him
      to have the carriage finished OUT OF HAND. 'Ah, now! Mordy, my precious!
      let us have it by the birthday, and come and dine with us o' Monday, at
      the Hibernian Hotel&#8212;there's a rare one&#8212;will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai accepted the invitation, and promised faithfully that the SUICIDE
      should be finished by the birthday. Sir Terence shook hands upon this
      promise, and, after telling a good story, which made one of the workmen in
      the yard&#8212;an Irishman&#8212;grin with delight, walked off. Mordicai,
      first waiting till the knight was out of hearing, called aloud&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You grinning rascal! mind, at your peril, and don't let that there
      carriage be touched, d'ye see, till further orders.'
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Mr. Mordicai's clerks, with a huge long-feathered pen behind his
      ear, observed that Mr. Mordicai was right in that caution, for that, to
      the best of his comprehension, Sir Terence O'Fay and his principal, too,
      were over head and ears in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai coolly answered that he was well aware of that; but that the
      estate could afford to dip further; that, for his part, he was under no
      apprehension; he knew how to look sharp, and to bite before he was bit.
      That he knew Sir Terence and his principal were leagued together to give
      the creditors THE GO BY, but that, clever as they both were at that work,
      he trusted he was their match.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you be so good, sir, to finish making out this estimate for me?'
      interrupted Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Immediately, sir. Sixty-nine pound four, and the perch. Let us see&#8212;Mr.
      Mordicai, ask him, ask Paddy, about Sir Terence,' said the foreman,
      pointing back over his shoulder to the Irish workman, who was at this
      moment pretending to be wondrous hard at work. However, when Mr. Mordicai
      defied him to tell him anything he did not know, Paddy, parting with an
      untasted bit of tobacco, began, and recounted some of Sir Terence O'Fay's
      exploits in evading duns, replevying cattle, fighting sheriffs, bribing
      SUBS, managing cants, tricking CUSTODEES, in language so strange, and with
      a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest, that, whilst
      Mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment, Lord Colambre could
      not help laughing, partly at, and partly with, his countryman. All the
      yard were in a roar of laughter, though they did not understand half of
      what they heard; but their risible muscles were acted upon mechanically,
      or maliciously, merely by the sound of the Irish brogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai, waiting till the laugh was over, dryly observed that 'the law is
      executed in another guess sort of way in England from what it is in
      Ireland'; therefore, for his part, he desired nothing better than to set
      his wits fairly against such SHARKS. That there was a pleasure in doing up
      a debtor which none but a creditor could know.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In a moment, sir; if you'll have a moment's patience, sir, if you
      please,' said the slow foreman to Lord Colambre; 'I must go down the
      pounds once more, and then I'll let you have it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what, Smithfield,' continued Mr. Mordicai, coming close
      beside his foreman, and speaking very low, but with a voice trembling with
      anger, for he was piqued by his foreman's doubts of his capacity to cope
      with Sir Terence O'Fay; 'I'll tell you what, Smithfield, I'll be cursed,
      if I don't get every inch of them into my power. You know how?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are the best judge, sir,' replied the foreman; 'but I would not
      undertake Sir Terence; and the question is, whether the estate will answer
      the LOT of the debts, and whether you know them all for certain?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do, sir, I tell you. There's Green there's Blancham&#8212;there's Gray&#8212;there's
      Soho&#8212;naming several more&#8212;and, to my knowledge, Lord Clonbrony&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop, sir,' cried Lord Colambre in a voice which made Mordicai, and
      everybody present, start&#8212;'I am his son&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil!' said Mordicai.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless every bone in his body, then! he's an Irishman,' cried Paddy;
      'and there was the RASON my heart warmed to him from the first minute he
      come into the yard, though I did not know it till now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, sir! are you my Lord Colambre?' said Mr. Mordicai, recovering, but
      not clearly recovering, his intellects. 'I beg pardon, but I did not know
      you WAS Lord Colambre. I thought you told me you was the friend of Mr.
      Berryl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not see the incompatibility of the assertion, sir,' replied Lord
      Colambre, taking from the bewildered foreman's unresisting hand the
      account, which he had been so long FURNISHING.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give me leave, my lord,' said Mordicai. 'I beg your pardon, my lord,
      perhaps we can compromise that business for your friend Mr. Berryl; since
      he is your lordship's friend, perhaps we can contrive to COMPROMISE and
      SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      TO COMPROMISE and SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE, Mordicai thought were favourite
      phrases, and approved Hibernian modes of doing business, which would
      conciliate this young Irish nobleman, and dissipate the proud tempest
      which had gathered and now swelled in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir, no!' cried Lord Colambre, holding firm the paper. 'I want no
      favour from you. I will accept of none for my friend or for myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Favour! No, my lord, I should not presume to offer&#8212;But I should
      wish, if you'll allow me, to do your friend justice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre recollecting that he had no right, in his pride, to ding
      away his friend's money, let Mr. Mordicai look at the account; and, his
      impetuous temper in a few moments recovered by good sense, he considered
      that, as his person was utterly unknown to Mr. Mordicai, no offence could
      have been intended to him, and that, perhaps, in what had been said of his
      father's debts and distress, there might be more truth than he was aware
      of. Prudently, therefore, controlling his feelings, and commanding
      himself, he suffered Mr. Mordicai to show him into a parlour, to SETTLE
      his friend's business. In a few minutes the account was reduced to a
      reasonable form, and, in consideration of the partner's having made the
      bargain, by which Mr. Mordicai felt himself influenced in honour, though
      not bound in law, he undertook to have the curricle made better than new
      again, for Mr. Berryl, for twenty guineas. Then came awkward apologies to
      Lord Colambre, which he ill endured. 'Between ourselves, my lord,'
      continued Mordicai&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the familiarity of the phrase, 'Between ourselves'&#8212;this
      implication of equality&#8212;Lord Colambre could not admit; he moved
      hastily towards the door and departed.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Full of what he had heard, and impatient to obtain further information
      respecting the state of his father's affairs, Lord Colambre hastened home;
      but his father was out, and his mother was engaged with Mr. Soho,
      directing, or rather being directed, how her apartments should be fitted
      up for her gala. As Lord Colambre entered the room, he saw his mother,
      Miss Nugent, and Mr. Soho, standing at a large table, which was covered
      with rolls of paper, patterns, and drawings of furniture: Mr. Soho was
      speaking in a conceited dictatorial tone, asserting that there was no
      'colour in nature for that room equal to THE BELLY-O'-THE FAWN;' which
      BELLY-O'-THE FAWN he so pronounced that Lady Clonbrony understood it to be
      LA BELLE UNIFORME, and, under this mistake, repeated and assented to the
      assertion till it was set to rights, with condescending superiority, by
      the upholsterer. This first architectural upholsterer of the age, as he
      styled himself, and was universally admitted to be by all the world of
      fashion, then, with full powers given to him, spoke EN MAITRE. The whole
      face of things must be changed&#8212;there must be new hangings, new
      draperies, new cornices, new candelabras, new everything!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">      The upholsterer's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br />      Glances from ceiling to floor, from floor to ceiling;<br />      And, as imagination bodies forth<br />      The form of things unknown, th' upholsterer's pencil<br />      Turns to shape and gives to airy nothing<br />      A local habitation and a NAME.<br />    </pre>
    <p>
      Of the value of a NAME no one could be more sensible than Mr. Soho.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your la'ship sees&#8212;this is merely a scratch of my pencil&#8212;your
      la'ship's sensible&#8212;just to give you an idea of the shape, the form
      of the thing. You fill up your angles here with ECOINIERES&#8212;round
      your walls with the TURKISH TENT DRAPERY&#8212;a fancy of my own&#8212;in

      decorated with imitative bronze ornaments; under the entablature, A
      VALANCE IN PELMETS, of puffed scarlet silk, would have an unparalleled
      grand effect, seen through the arches&#8212;with the TREBISOND TRELLICE
      PAPER, would make a TOUT ENSEMBLE, novel beyond example. On that Trebisond
      trellice paper, I confess, ladies, I do pique myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, for the little room, I recommend turning it temporarily into a
      Chinese pagoda, with this CHINESE PAGODA PAPER, with the PORCELAIN border,
      and josses, and jars, and beakers to match; and I can venture to promise
      one vase of pre-eminent size and beauty. Oh, indubitably! if your la'ship
      prefers it, you can have the EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHIC PAPER, with the IBIS
      BORDER to match! The only objection is, one sees it everywhere&#8212;quite
      antediluvian&#8212;gone to the hotels even; but, to be sure, if your
      la'ship has a fancy&#8212;At all events, I humbly recommend, what her
      Grace of Torcaster longs to patronise, my MOON CURTAINS, with candlelight
      draperies. A demisaison elegance this&#8212;I hit off yesterday&#8212;and&#8212;true,
      your la'ship's quite correct&#8212;out of the common, completely. And, of
      course, you'd have the SPHYNX CANDELABRAS, and the Phoenix argands. Oh!
      nothing else lights now, ma'am! Expense! Expense of the whole! Impossible
      to calculate here on the spot!&#8212;but nothing at all worth your
      ladyship's consideration!'
    </p>
    <p>
      At another moment, Lord Colambre might have been amused with all this
      rhodomontade, and with the airs and voluble conceit of the orator; but,
      after what he had heard at Mr. Mordicai's, this whole scene struck him
      more with melancholy than with mirth. He was alarmed by the prospect of
      new and unbounded expense; provoked, almost past enduring, by the jargon
      and impertinence of this upholsterer; mortified and vexed to the heart to
      see his mother the dupe, the sport of such a coxcomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prince of puppies!&#8212;insufferable!&#8212;My own mother!' Lord
      Colambre repeated to himself, as he walked hastily up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre, won't you let us have your judgment&#8212;your TEESTE' said his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excuse me, ma'am. I have no taste, no judgment, in these things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He sometimes paused, and looked at Mr. Soho with a strong inclination to&#8212;But
      knowing that he should say too much, if he said anything, he was silent
      never dared to approach the council table&#8212;but continued walking up
      and down the room, till he heard a voice, which at once arrested his
      attention, and soothed his ire. He approached the table instantly, and
      listened, whilst Grace Nugent said everything he wished to have said, and
      with all the propriety and delicacy with which he thought he could not
      have spoken. He leaned on the table, and fixed his eyes upon her&#8212;years
      ago, he had seen his cousin&#8212;last night, he had thought her handsome,
      pleasing, graceful&#8212;but now, he saw a new person, or he saw her in a
      new light. He marked the superior intelligence, the animation, the
      eloquence of her countenance, its variety, whilst alternately, with arch
      raillery or grave humour, she played off Mr. Soho, and made him magnify
      the ridicule, till it was apparent even to Lady Clonbrony. He observed the
      anxiety, lest his mother should expose her own foibles&#8212;he was
      touched by the respectful, earnest kindness&#8212;the soft tones of
      persuasion, with which she addressed his mother&#8212;the care not to
      presume upon her own influence&#8212;the good sense, the taste she showed,
      yet not displaying her superiority&#8212;the address, temper, and
      patience, with which she at last accomplished her purpose, and prevented
      Lady Clonbrony from doing anything preposterously absurd, or exorbitantly
      extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was actually sorry when the business was ended&#8212;when
      Mr. Soho departed&#8212;for Grace Nugent was then silent; and it was
      necessary to remove his eyes from that countenance, on which he had gazed
      unobserved. Beautiful and graceful, yet so unconscious was she of her
      charms, that the eye of admiration could rest upon her without her
      perceiving it&#8212;she seemed so intent upon others as totally to forget
      herself. The whole train of Lord Colambre's thoughts was so completely
      deranged that, although he was sensible there was something of importance
      he had to say to his mother, yet, when Mr. Soho's departure left him
      opportunity to speak, he stood silent, unable to recollect anything but&#8212;Grace
      Nugent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Grace Nugent left the room, after some minutes' silence, and some
      effort, Lord Colambre said to his mother, 'Pray, madam, do you know
      anything of Sir Terence O'Fay?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I!' Said Lady Clonbrony, drawing up her head proudly; 'I know he is a
      person I cannot endure. He is no friend of mine, I can assure you&#8212;nor
      any such sort of person.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought it was impossible!' cried Colambre, with exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only wish your father, Colambre, could say as much,' added Lady
      Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre's countenance fell again; and again he was silent for some
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does my father dine at home, ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose not; he seldom dines at home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps, ma'am, my father may have some cause to be uneasy about&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About?' said Lady Clonbrony, in a tone, and with a look of curiosity
      which convinced her son that she knew nothing of his debts or distresses,
      if he had any. 'About what?' repeated her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was no receding, and Lord Colambre never had recourse to artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About his affairs, I was going to say, madam. But, since you know nothing
      of any difficulties or embarrassments, I am persuaded that none exist.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, I CAWNT tell you that, Colambre. There are difficulties for ready
      money, I confess, when I ask for it, which surprise me often. I know
      nothing of affairs&#8212;ladies of a certain rank seldom do, you know.
      But, considering your father's estate, and the fortune I brought him,'
      added her ladyship, proudly, 'I CAWNT conceive it at all. Grace Nugent,
      indeed, often talks to me of embarrassments and economy; but that, poor
      thing, is very natural for her, because her fortune is not particularly
      large, and she has left it all, or almost all, in her uncle and guardian's
      hands. I know she's often distressed for odd money to lend me, and that
      makes her anxious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is not Miss Nugent very much admired, ma'am, in London?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course&#8212;in the company she is in, you know, she has every
      advantage. And she has a natural family air of fashion&#8212;not but what
      she would have got on much better, if, when she first appeared in Lon'on,
      she had taken my advice, and wrote herself on her cards Miss de Nogent,
      which would have taken off the prejudice against the IRICISM of Nugent,
      you know; and there is a Count de Nogent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not know there was any such prejudice, ma'am. There may be among a
      certain set; but, I should think, not among well-informed, well-bred
      people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I BIG your PAWDON, Colambre; surely I, that was born in England, an
      Henglish-woman BAWN! must be well INFAWMED on this PINT, anyway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was respectfully silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mother,' resumed he, 'I wonder that Miss Nugent is not married!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is her own fau't, entirely; she has refused very good offers&#8212;establishments
      that, I own, I think, as Lady Langdale says, I was to blame to allow her
      to let pass; but young LEDIES till they are twenty, always think they can
      do better. Mr. Martingale, of Martingale, proposed for her, but she
      objected to him on account of he's being on the turf; and Mr. St. Albans'
      L7000 a year&#8212;because&#8212;I REELLY forget what&#8212;I believe only
      because she did not like him&#8212;and something about principles. Now
      there is Colonel Heathcock, one of the most fashionable young men you see,
      always with the Duchess of Torcaster and that set&#8212;Heathcock takes a
      vast deal of notice of her, for him; and yet, I'm persuaded, she would not
      have him to-morrow, if he came to the PINT, and for no reason, REELLY now,
      that she can give me, but because she says he's a coxcomb. Grace has a
      tincture of Irish pride. But, for my part, I rejoice that she is so
      difficult, for I don't know what I should do without her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Nugent is indeed&#8212;very much attached to you, mother, I am
      convinced,' said Lord Colambre, beginning his sentence with great
      enthusiasm, and ending it with great sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed then, she's a sweet girl, and I am very partial to her, there's
      the truth,' cried Lady Clonbrony, in an undisguised Irish accent, and with
      her natural warm manner. But a moment afterwards her features and whole
      form resumed their constrained stillness and stiffness, and, in her
      English accent, she continued&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before you put my IDEES out of my head, Colambre, I had something to say
      to you&#8212;Oh! I know what it was&#8212;we were talking of
      embarrassments&#8212;and I wished to do your father the justice to mention
      to you that he has been UNCOMMON LIBERAL to me about this gala, and has
      REELLY given me carte-blanche; and I've a notion&#8212;indeed I know&#8212;that
      it is you, Colambre, I am to thank for this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me!&#8212;ma'am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes! Did not your father give you any hint?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, ma'am; I have seen my father but for half an hour since I came to
      town, and in that time he said nothing to me&#8212;of his affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what I allude to is more your affair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He did not speak to me of any affairs, ma'am&#8212;he spoke only of my
      horses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I suppose my lord leaves it to me to open the matter to you. I have
      the pleasure to tell you, that we have in view for you&#8212;and I think I
      may say with more than the approbation of all her family&#8212;an alliance&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! my dear mother! you cannot be serious,' cried Lord Colambre; 'you
      know I am not of years of discretion yet&#8212;I shall not think of
      marrying these ten years, at least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not? Nay, my dear Colambre, don't go, I beg&#8212;I am serious, I
      assure you&#8212;and, to convince you of it, I shall tell you candidly, at
      once, all your father told me: that now you've done with Cambridge, and
      are come to Lon'on, he agrees with me in wishing that you should make the
      figure you ought to make, Colambre, as sole heir-apparent to the Clonbrony
      estate, and all that sort of thing. But, on the other hand, living in
      Lon'on, and making you the handsome allowance you ought to have, are, both
      together, more than your father can afford, without inconvenience, he
      tells me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I assure you, mother, I shall be content&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; you must not be content, child, and you must hear me. You must
      live in a becoming style, and make a proper appearance. I could not
      present you to my friends here, nor be happy, if you did not, Colambre.
      Now the way is clear before you: you have birth and title, here is fortune
      ready made; you will have a noble estate of your own when old Quin dies,
      and you will not be any encumbrance or inconvenience to your father or
      anybody. Marrying an heiress accomplishes all this at once; and the young
      lady is everything we could wish, besides&#8212;you will meet again at the
      gala. Indeed, between ourselves, she is the grand object of the gala; all
      her friends will come EN MASSE, and one should wish that they should see
      things in proper style. You have seen the young lady in question, Colambre&#8212;Miss
      Broadhurst. Don't you recollect the young lady I introduced you to last
      night after the opera?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The little, plain girl, covered with diamonds, who was standing beside
      Miss Nugent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In di'monds, yes. But you won't think her plain when you see more of her&#8212;that
      wears off; I thought her plain, at first&#8212;I hope&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope,' said Lord Colambre, 'that you will not take it unkindly of me,
      my dear mother, if I tell you, at once, that I have no thoughts of
      marrying at present&#8212;and that I never will marry for money. Marrying
      an heiress is not even a new way of paying old debts&#8212;at all events,
      it is one to which no distress could persuade me to have recourse; and as
      I must, if I outlive old Mr. Quin, have an independent fortune, THERE IS
      NO occasion to purchase one by marriage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no distress, that I know of, in the case,' cried Lady Clonbrony.
      'Where is your imagination running, Colambre? But merely for your
      establishment, your independence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Establishment, I want none&#8212;independence I do desire, and will
      preserve. Assure my father, my DEAR MOTHER, that I will not be an expense
      to him. I will live within the allowance he made me at Cambridge&#8212;I
      will give up half of it&#8212;I will do anything for his convenience&#8212;but
      marry for money, that I cannot do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, Colambre, you are very disobliging,' said Lady Clonbrony, with an
      expression of disappointment and displeasure; 'for your father says, if
      you don't marry Miss Broadhurst, we can't live in Lon'on another winter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This said&#8212;which, had she been at the moment mistress of herself, she
      would not have let out&#8212;Lady Clonbrony abruptly quitted the room. Her
      son stood motionless, saying to himself&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this my mother?&#8212;How altered!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he seized an opportunity of speaking to his father, whom
      he caught, with difficulty, just when he was going out, as usual, for the
      day. Lord Colambre, with all the respect due to his father, and with that
      affectionate manner by which he always knew how to soften the strength of
      his expressions, made nearly the same declarations of his resolution, by
      which his mother had been so much surprised and offended. Lord Clonbrony
      seemed more embarrassed, but not so much displeased. When Lord Colambre
      adverted, as delicately as he could, to the selfishness of desiring from
      him the sacrifice of liberty for life, to say nothing of his affections,
      merely to enable his family to make a splendid figure in London, Lord
      Clonbrony exclaimed, 'That's all nonsense!&#8212;cursed nonsense! That's
      the way we are obliged to state the thing to your mother, my dear boy,
      because I might talk her deaf before she would understand or listen to
      anything else. But, for my own share, I don't care a rush if London was
      sunk in the salt sea. Little Dublin for my money, as Sir Terence O'Fay
      says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is Sir Terence O'Fay, may I ask, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, don't you know Terry? Ay, you've been so long at Cambridge, I
      forgot. And did you never see Terry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have seen him, sir&#8212;I met him yesterday at Mr. Mordicai's, the
      coachmaker's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mordicai's!' exclaimed Lord Clonbrony, with a sudden blush, which he
      endeavoured to hide by taking snuff. 'He is a damned rascal, that
      Mordicai! I hope you didn't believe a word he said&#8212;nobody does that
      knows him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad, sir, that you seem to know him so well, and to be upon your
      guard against him,' replied Lord Colambre; 'for, from what I heard of his
      conversation, when he was not aware who I was, I am convinced he would do
      you any injury in his power.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He shall never have me in his power, I promise him. We shall take care of
      that. But what did he say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre repeated the substance of what Mordicai had said, and Lord
      Clonbrony reiterated&#8212;'Damned rascal!&#8212;damned rascal! I'll get
      out of his hands; I'll have no more to do with him.' But, as he spoke, he
      exhibited evident symptoms of uneasiness, moving continually, and shifting
      from leg to leg like a foundered horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not bring himself positively to deny that he had debts and
      difficulties; but he would by no means open the state of his affairs to
      his son&#8212;'No father is called upon to do that,' said he to himself;
      'none but a fool would do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, perceiving his father's embarrassment, withdrew his eyes,
      respectfully refrained from all further inquiries, and simply repeated the
      assurance he had made to his mother, that he would put his family to no
      additional expense; and that, if it was necessary, he would willingly give
      up half his allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all&#8212;not at all, my dear boy,' said his father; 'I would
      rather cramp myself than that you should be cramped, a thousand times
      over. But it is all my Lady Clonbrony's nonsense. If people would but, as
      they ought, stay in their own country, live on their own estates, and kill
      their own mutton, money need never be wanting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For killing their own mutton, Lord Colambre did not see the indispensable
      necessity; but he rejoiced to hear his father assert that people should
      reside in their own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay,' cried Lord Clonbrony, to strengthen his assertion, as he always
      thought it necessary to do, by quoting some other person's opinion. 'So
      Sir Terence O'Fay always says, and that's the reason your mother can't
      endure poor Terry. You don't know Terry? No, you have only seen him; but,
      indeed, to see him is to know him; for he is the most off-hand, good
      fellow in Europe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't pretend to know him yet,' said Lord Colambre. 'I am not so
      presumptuous as to form my opinion at first sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, curse your modesty!' interrupted Lord Clonbrony; 'you mean, you don't
      pretend to like him yet; but Terry will make you like him. I defy you not.
      I'll introduce you to him&#8212;him to you, I mean&#8212;most
      warn-hearted, generous dog upon earth&#8212;convivial&#8212;jovial&#8212;with
      wit and humour enough, in his own way, to split you&#8212;split me if he
      has not. You need not cast down your eyes, Colambre. What's your
      objection?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have made none, sir; but, if you urge me, I can only say that, if he
      has all these good qualities, it is to be regretted that he does not look
      and speak a little more like a gentleman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A gentleman! he is as much a gentleman as any of your formal prigs&#8212;not
      the exact Cambridge cut, maybe. Curse your English education! 'Twas none
      of my advice. I suppose you mean to take after your mother in the notion
      that nothing can be good, or genteel, but what's English.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Far from it, sir; I assure you, I am as warm a friend to Ireland as your
      heart could wish. You will have no reason, in that respect at least, nor,
      I hope, in any other, to curse my English education; and, if my gratitude
      and affection can avail, you shall never regret the kindness and
      liberality with which you have, I fear, distressed yourself to afford me
      the means of becoming all that a British nobleman ought to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gad! you distress me now!' said Lord Clonbrony, 'and I didn't expect it,
      or I wouldn't make a fool of myself this way,' added he, ashamed of his
      emotion, and whiffling it off. 'You have an Irish heart, that I see, which
      no education can spoil. But you must like Terry. I'll give you time, as he
      said to me, when first he taught me to like usquebaugh. Good morning to
      you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Lady Clonbrony, in consequence of her residence in London, had
      become more of a fine lady, Lord Clonbrony, since he left Ireland, had
      become less of a gentleman. Lady Clonbrony, born an Englishwoman,
      disclaiming and disencumbering herself of all the Irish in town, had, by
      giving splendid entertainments, at an enormous expense, made her way into
      a certain set of fashionable company. But Lord Clonbrony, who was somebody
      in Ireland, who was a great person in Dublin, found himself nobody in
      England, a mere cipher in London, Looked down upon by the fine people with
      whom his lady associated, and heartily weary of them, he retreated from
      them altogether, and sought entertainment and self-complacency in society
      beneath him&#8212;indeed, both in rank and education, but in which he had
      the satisfaction of feeling himself the first person in company. Of these
      associates, the first in talents, and in jovial profligacy, was Sir
      Terence O'Fay&#8212;a man of low extraction, who had been knighted by an
      Irish lord-lieutenant in some convivial frolic. No one could tell a good
      story, or sing a good song better than Sir Terence; he exaggerated his
      native brogue, and his natural propensity to blunder, caring little
      whether the company laughed at him or with him, provided they laughed.
      'Live and laugh&#8212;laugh and live,' was his motto; and certainly he
      lived on laughing, as well as many better men can contrive to live on a
      thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony brought Sir Terence home with him next day to introduce him
      to Lord Colambre; and it happened that on this occasion Terence appeared
      to peculiar disadvantage, because, like many other people, 'Il gatoit
      l'esprit qu'il avoit en voulant avoir celui qu'il n'avoit pas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been apprised that Lord Colambre was a fine scholar, fresh from
      Cambridge, and being conscious of his own deficiencies of literature,
      instead of trusting to his natural talents, he summoned to his aid, with
      no small effort, all the scraps of learning he had acquired in early days,
      and even brought before the company all the gods and goddesses with whom
      he had formed an acquaintance at school. Though embarrassed by this
      unusual encumbrance of learning, he endeavoured to make all subservient to
      his immediate design, of paying his court to Lady Clonbrony, by forwarding
      the object she had most anxiously in view&#8212;the match between her son
      and Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so, Miss Nugent,' said he, not daring, with all his assurance, to
      address himself directly to Lady Clonbrony&#8212;'and so, Miss Nugent, you
      are going to have great doings, I'm told, and a wonderful grand gala.
      There's nothing in the wide world equal to being in a good, handsome
      crowd. No later now than the last ball at the Castle that was before I
      left Dublin, Miss Nugent&#8212;the apartments, owing to the popularity of
      my lady-lieutenant, was so throng&#8212;so throng&#8212;that I remember
      very well, in the doorway, a lady&#8212;and a very genteel woman she was
      too, though a stranger to me&#8212;saying to me, "Sir, your finger's in my
      ear." "I know it, madam," says I, "but I can't take it out till the crowd
      give me elbow room."
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's gala I'm thinking of now. I hear you are to have the golden
      Venus, my Lady Clonbrony, won't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This freezing monosyllable notwithstanding, Sir Terence pursued his course
      fluently. 'The golden Venus!&#8212;Sure, Miss Nugent, you, that are so
      quick, can't but know I would apostrophise Miss Broadhurst that is, but
      that won't be long so, I hope. My Lord Colambre, have you seen much yet of
      that young lady?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I hope you won't be long so. I hear great talk now of the Venus of
      Medicis, and the Venus of this and that, with the Florence Venus, and the
      sable Venus, and that other Venus, that's washing of her hair, and a
      hundred other Venuses, some good, some bad. But, be that as it will, my
      lord, trust a fool&#8212;ye may, when he tells you truth&#8212;the golden
      Venus is the only one on earth that can stand, or that will stand, through
      all ages and temperatures; for gold rules the court, gold rules the camp,
      and men below, and heaven above.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heaven above! Take care, Terry! Do you know what you're saying?'
      interrupted Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do I? Don't I?' replied Terry. 'Deny, if you please, my lord, that it was
      for a golden pippin that the three goddesses FIT&#8212;and that the
      HIPPOMENES was about golden apples&#8212;and did not Hercules rob a garden
      for golden apples?&#8212;and did not the pious Eneas himself take a golden
      branch with him, to make himself welcome to his father in hell?' said Sir
      Terence, winking at Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, Terry, you know more about books than I should have suspected,' said
      Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor you would not have suspected me to have such a great acquaintance
      among the goddesses neither, would you, my lord? But, apropos, before we
      quit, of what material, think ye, was that same Venus's famous girdle,
      now, that made roses and lilies so quickly appear? Why, what was it, but a
      girdle of sterling gold, I'll engage?&#8212;for gold is the only true
      thing for a young man to look after in a wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence paused, but no applause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let them talk of Cupids and darts, and the mother of the Loves and
      Graces. Minerva may sing odes and DYTHAMBRICS, or whatsoever her
      wisdomship pleases. Let her sing, or let her say she'll never get a
      husband in this world or the other, without she had a good thumping
      FORTIN, and then she'd go off like wildfire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, Terry, there you're out; Minerva has too bad a character for
      learning to be a favourite with gentlemen,' said Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tut&#8212;Don't tell me!&#8212;I'd get her off before you could say Jack
      Robinson, and thank you too, if she had fifty thousand down, or a thousand
      a year in land. Would you have a man so d-d nice as to balk when house and
      land is a-going&#8212;a-going&#8212;a-going!&#8212;because of the
      encumbrance of a little learning? I never heard that Miss Broadhurst was
      anything of a learned lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Broadhurst!' said Grace Nugent; 'how did you get round to Miss
      Broadhurst?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! by the way of Tipperary,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, my lord, it was apropos to a good fortune, which, I
      hope, will not be out of your way, even if you went by Tipperary. She has,
      besides L100,000 in the funds, a clear landed property of L10,000 per
      annum. WELL! SOME PEOPLE TALK OF MORALITY, AND SOME OF RELIGION, BUT GIVE
      ME A LITTLE SNUG PROPERTY. But, my lord, I've a little business to
      transact this morning, and must not be idling and indulging myself here.'
      So, bowing to the ladies, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, I am glad that man is gone,' said Lady Clonbrony. 'What a relief
      to one's ears! I am sure I wonder, my lord, how you can bear to carry that
      strange creature always about with you&#8212;so vulgar as he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He diverts me,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'while many of your correct-mannered
      fine ladies or gentlemen put me to sleep. What signifies what accent
      people speak in that have nothing to say&#8212;hey, Colambre?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, from respect to his father, did not express his opinion,
      but his aversion to Sir Terence O'Fay was stronger even than his mother's;
      though Lady Clonbrony's detestation of him was much increased by
      perceiving that his coarse hints about Miss Broadhurst had operated
      against her favourite scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, at breakfast, Lord Clonbrony talked of bringing Sir
      Terence with him that night to her gala. She absolutely grew pale with
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens! Lady Langdale, Mrs. Dareville, Lady Pococke, Lady
      Chatterton, Lady D&#8212;, Lady G&#8212;, his Grace of V&#8212;; what
      would they think of him? And Miss Broadhurst to see him going about with
      my Lord Clonbrony!'&#8212;It could not be. No; her ladyship made the most
      solemn and desperate protestation, that she would sooner give up her gala
      altogether&#8212;tie up the knocker&#8212;say she was sick&#8212;rather be
      sick, or be dead, than be obliged to have such a creature as Sir Terence
      O'Fay at her gala.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have it your own way, my dear, as you have everything else!' cried Lord
      Clonbrony, taking up his hat, and preparing to decamp; 'but, take notice,
      if you won't receive him you need not expect me. So a good morning to you,
      my Lady Clonbrony. You may find a worse friend in need, yet, than that
      same Sir Terence O'Fay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I trust I shall never be in need, my lord,' replied her ladyship. 'It
      would be strange, indeed, if I were, with the fortune I brought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! that fortune of hers!' cried Lord Clonbrony, stopping both his ears
      as he ran out of the room; 'shall I never hear the end of that fortune,
      when I've seen the end of it long ago?'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this matrimonial dialogue, Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre never
      once looked at each other. Grace was very diligently trying the changes
      that could be made in the positions of a china-mouse, a cat, a dog, a cup,
      and a Brahmin, on the mantelpiece; Lord Colambre as diligently reading the
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, my dear Colambre,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'put down the paper, and
      listen to me. Let me entreat you not to neglect Miss Broadhurst to-night,
      as I know that the family come here chiefly on your account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear mother, I never can neglect any deserving young lady, and
      particularly one of your guests; but I shall be careful not to do more
      than not to neglect, for I never will pretend what I do not feel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Colambre, Miss Broadhurst is everything you could wish,
      except being a beauty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps, madam,' said Lord Colambre, fixing his eyes on Grace Nugent,
      'you think that I can see no farther than a handsome face?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The unconscious Grace Nugent now made a warm eulogium of Miss Broadhurst's
      sense, and wit, and independence of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not know that Miss Broadhurst was a friend of yours, Miss Nugent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is, I assure you, a friend of mine; and, as a proof, I will not
      praise her at this moment. I will go farther still&#8212;I will promise
      that I never will praise her to you till you begin to praise her to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre smiled, and now listened, as if he wished that Grace should
      go on speaking, even of Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's my sweet Grace!' cried Lady Clonbrony. 'Oh! she knows how to
      manage these men&#8212;not one of them can resist her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, for his part, did not deny the truth of this assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace,' added Lady Clonbrony, 'make him promise to do as we would have
      him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; promises are dangerous things to ask or to give,' said Grace. 'Men
      and naughty children never make promises, especially promises to be good,
      without longing to break them the next minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, at least, child, persuade him, I charge you, to make my gala go off
      well. That's the first thing we ought to think of now. Ring the bell! And
      all heads and hands I put in requisition for the gala.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The opening of her gala, the display of her splendid reception-rooms, the
      Turkish tent, the Alhambra, the pagoda, formed a proud moment to Lady
      Clonbrony. Much did she enjoy, and much too naturally, notwithstanding all
      her efforts to be stiff and stately, much too naturally did she show her
      enjoyment of the surprise excited in some and affected by others on their
      first entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One young, very young lady expressed her astonishment so audibly as to
      attract the notice of all the bystanders. Lady Clonbrony, delighted,
      seized both her hands, shook them, and laughed heartily; then, as the
      young lady with her party passed on, her ladyship recovered herself, drew
      up her head, and said to the company near her&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor thing! I hope I covered her little NAIVETE properly? How NEW she
      must be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with well-practised dignity, and half-subdued self-complacency of
      aspect, her ladyship went gliding about&#8212;most importantly busy,
      introducing my lady THIS to the sphynx candelabra, and my lady THAT to the
      Trebisond trellice; placing some delightfully for the perspective of the
      Alhambra; establishing others quite to her satisfaction on seraglio
      ottomans; and honouring others with a seat under the statira canopy.
      Receiving and answering compliments from successive crowds of select
      friends, imagining herself the mirror of fashion, and the admiration of
      the whole world, Lady Clonbrony was, for her hour, as happy certainly as
      ever woman was in similar circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son looked at her, and wished that this happiness could last.
      Naturally inclined to sympathy, Lord Colambre reproached himself for not
      feeling as gay at this instant as the occasion required. But the festive
      scene, the blazing lights, the 'universal hubbub,' failed to raise his
      spirits. As a dead weight upon them hung the remembrance of Mordicai's
      denunciations; and, through the midst of this Eastern magnificence, this
      unbounded profusion, he thought he saw future domestic misery and ruin to
      those he loved best in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only object present on which his eye rested with pleasure was Grace
      Nugent. Beautiful&#8212;in elegant and dignified simplicity&#8212;thoughtless
      of herself&#8212;yet with a look of thought, and with an air of
      melancholy, which accorded exactly with his own feelings, and which he
      believed to arise from the same reflections that had passed in his own
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Broadhurst, Colambre! all the Broadhursts!' said his mother,
      wakening him, as she passed by, to receive them as they entered. Miss
      Broadhurst appeared, plainly dressed&#8212;plainly, even to singularity&#8212;without
      any diamonds or ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Brought Philippa to you, my dear Lady Clonbrony, this figure, rather than
      not bring her at all,' said puffing Mrs. Broadhurst; 'and had all the
      difficulty in the world to get her out at all, and now I've promised she
      shall stay but half an hour. Sore throat&#8212;terrible cold she took in
      the morning. I'll swear for her, she'd not have come for any one but you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady did not seem inclined to swear, or even to say this for
      herself; she stood wonderfully unconcerned and passive, with an expression
      of humour lurking in her eyes, and about the corners of her mouth; whilst
      Lady Clonbrony was 'shocked,' and 'gratified,' and 'concerned' and
      'flattered' and whilst everybody was hoping, and fearing, and busying
      themselves about her&#8212;'Miss Broadhurst, you'd better sit here!'&#8212;'Oh,
      for Heaven's sake! Miss Broadhurst, not there!' 'Miss Broadhurst, if
      you'll take my opinion;' and 'Miss Broadhurst, if I may advise&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace Nugent!' cried Lady Clonbrony&#8212;'Miss Broadhurst always listens
      to you. Do, my dear, persuade Miss Broadhurst to take care of herself, and
      let us take her to the inner little pagoda, where she can be so warm and
      so retired&#8212;the very thing for an invalid. Colambre! pioneer the way
      for us, for the crowd's immense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne and Lady Catharine H&#8212;, Lady Langdale's daughters, were at
      this time leaning on Miss Nugent's arm, and moved along with this party to
      the inner pagoda. There was to be cards in one room, music in another,
      dancing in a third, and, in this little room, there were prints and
      chess-boards, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here you will be quite to yourselves,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'let me
      establish you comfortably in this, which I call my sanctuary&#8212;my
      SNUGGERY&#8212;Colambre, that little table!&#8212;Miss Broadhurst, you
      play chess? Colambre, you'll play with Miss Broadhurst&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thank your ladyship,' said Miss Broadhurst, 'but I know nothing of
      chess, but the moves. Lady Catharine, you will play, and I will look on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Broadhurst drew her seat to the fire; Lady Catharine sat down to play
      with Lord Colambre; Lady Clonbrony withdrew, again recommending Miss
      Broadhurst to Grace Nugent's care. After some commonplace conversation,
      Lady Anne H&#8212;-, looking at the company in the adjoining apartment,
      asked her sister how old Miss Somebody was, who passed by. This led to
      reflections upon the comparative age and youthful appearance of several of
      their acquaintance, and upon the care with which mothers concealed the age
      of their daughters. Glances passed between Lady Catharine and Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For my part,' said Miss Broadhurst, 'my mother would 'labour that point
      of secrecy in vain for me; for I am willing to tell my age, even if my
      face did not tell it for me, to all whom it may concern. I am past
      three-and-twenty&#8212;shall be four-and-twenty the 5th of next July.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three-and-twenty! Bless me! I thought you were not twenty!' cried Lady
      Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Four-and-twenty next July!&#8212;impossible!' cried Lady Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very possible,' said Miss Broadhurst, quite unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Lord Colambre, would you believe it? Can you believe it?' asked Lady
      Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he can,' said Miss Broadhurst. 'Don't you see that he believes it as
      firmly as you and I do? Why should you force his lordship to pay a
      compliment contrary to his better judgment, or to extort a smile from him
      under false pretences? I am sure he sees that you, ladies, and I trust he
      perceives that I, do not think the worse of him for this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre smiled now without any false pretence; and, relieved at once
      from all apprehension of her joining in his mother's views, or of her
      expecting particular attention from him, he became at ease with Miss
      Broadhurst, shelved a desire to converse with her, and listened eagerly to
      what she said. He recollected that Grace Nugent had told him that this
      young lady had no common character; and, neglecting his move at chess, he
      looked up at Grace as much as to say, 'DRAW HER OUT, pray.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grace was too good a friend to comply with that request; she left Miss
      Broadhurst to unfold her own character.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is your move, my lord,' said Lady Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your ladyship's pardon&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are not these rooms beautiful, Miss Broadhurst?' said Lady Catharine,
      determined, if possible, to turn the conversation into a commonplace, safe
      channel; for she had just felt, what most of Miss Broadhurst's
      acquaintance had in their turn felt, that she had an odd way of startling
      people, by setting their own secret little motives suddenly before them,
      'Are not these rooms beautiful?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beautiful!&#8212;Certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of the rooms would have answered Lady Catharine's purpose for
      some time, had not Lady Anne imprudently brought the conversation back
      again to Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know, Miss Broadhurst,' said she, 'that if I had fifty sore
      throats, I could not have refrained from my diamonds on this GALA night;
      and such diamonds as you have! Now, really, I could not believe you to be
      the same person we saw blazing at the opera the other night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really! could not you, Lady Anne? That is the very thing that entertains
      me. I only wish that I could lay aside my fortune sometimes, as well as my
      diamonds, and see how few people would know me then. Might not I, Grace,
      by the golden rule, which, next to practice, is the best rule in the
      world, calculate and answer that question?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am persuaded,' said Lord Colambre, 'that Miss Broadhurst has friends on
      whom the experiment would make no difference.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am convinced of it,' said Miss Broadhurst; 'and that is what makes me
      tolerably happy, though I have the misfortune to be an heiress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is the oddest speech,' said Lady Anne. 'Now I should so like to be a
      great heiress, and to have, like you, such thousands and thousands at
      command.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what can the thousands upon thousands do for me? Hearts, you know,
      Lady Anne, are to be won only by radiant eyes. Bought hearts your ladyship
      certainly would not recommend. They're such poor things&#8212;no wear at
      all. Turn them which way you will, you can make nothing of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've tried then, have you?' said Lady Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To my cost. Very nearly taken in by them half a dozen times; for they are
      brought to me by dozens; and they are so made up for sale, and the people
      do so swear to you that it's real, real love, and it looks so like it;
      and, if you stoop to examine it, you hear it pressed upon you by such
      elegant oaths&#8212;By all that's lovely!&#8212;By all my hopes of
      happiness!&#8212;By your own charming self! Why, what can one do but look
      like a fool, and believe; for these men, at the time, all look so like
      gentlemen, that one cannot bring oneself flatly to tell them that they are
      cheats and swindlers, that they are perjuring their precious souls.
      Besides, to call a lover a perjured creature is to encourage him. He would
      have a right to complain if you went back after that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dear! what a move was there!' cried Lady Catharine. 'Miss Broadhurst
      is so entertaining to-night, notwithstanding her sore throat, that one can
      positively attend to nothing else. And she talks of love and lovers too
      with such CONNAISSANCE DE FAIT&#8212;counts her lovers by dozens, tied up
      in true-lovers' knots!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lovers!&#8212;no, no! Did I say lovers?&#8212;suitors I should have said.
      There's nothing less like a lover, a true lover, than a suitor, as all the
      world knows, ever since the days of Penelope. Dozens!&#8212;never had a
      lover in my life! And fear, with much reason, I never shall have one to my
      mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, you've given up the game,' cried Lady Catharine; 'but you make
      no battle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be so vain to combat against your ladyship,' said Lord Colambre,
      rising, and bowing politely to Lady Catharine, but turning the next
      instant to converse with Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I talked of liking to be an heiress,' said Lady Anne, 'I was not
      thinking of lovers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. One is not always thinking of lovers, you know,' added Lady
      Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not always,' replied Miss Broadhurst. 'Well, lovers out of the question
      on all sides, what would your ladyship buy with the thousands upon
      thousands?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, everything, if I were you,' said Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rank, to begin with,' said Lady Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still my old objection&#8212;bought rank is but a shabby thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there is so little difference made between bought and hereditary rank
      in these days,' said Lady Catharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see a great deal still,' said Miss Broadhurst; 'so much, that I would
      never buy a title.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A title without birth, to be sure,' said Lady Anne, 'would not be so well
      worth buying; and as birth certainly is not to be bought&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And even birth, were it to be bought, I would not buy,' said Miss
      Broadhurst, 'unless I could be sure to have with it all the politeness,
      all the noble sentiments, all the magnanimity&#8212;in short, all that
      should grace and dignify high birth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Admirable!' said Lord Colambre. Grace Nugent smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre, will you have the goodness to put my mother in mind I must
      go away?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am bound to obey, but I am very sorry for it,' said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are we to have any dancing to-night, I wonder?' said Lady Catharine.
      'Miss Nugent, I am afraid we have made Miss Broadhurst talk so much, in
      spite of her hoarseness, that Lady Clonbrony will be quite angry with us.
      And here she comes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady Clonbrony came to hope, to beg, that Miss Broadhurst would not
      think of running away; but Miss Broadhurst could not be prevailed upon to
      stay. Lady Clonbrony was delighted to see that her son assisted Grace
      Nugent most carefully in SHAWLING Miss Broadhurst; his lordship conducted
      her to her carriage, and his mother drew many happy auguries from the
      gallantry of his manner, and from the young lady's having stayed
      three-quarters, instead of half an hour&#8212;a circumstance which Lady
      Catharine did not fail to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancing, which, under various pretences, Lady Clonbrony had delayed
      till Lord Colambre was at liberty, began immediately after Miss
      Broadhurst's departure; and the chalked mosaic pavement of the Alhambra
      was, in a few minutes, effaced by the dancers' feet. How transient are all
      human joys, especially those of vanity! Even on this long meditated, this
      long desired, this gala night, Lady Clonbrony found her triumph incomplete&#8212;inadequate
      to her expectations. For the first hour all had been compliment, success,
      and smiles; presently came the BUTS, and the hesitated objections, and the
      'damning with faint praise.' All THAT could be borne. Everybody has his
      taste&#8212;and one person's taste is as good as another's; and while she
      had Mr. Soho to cite, Lady Clonbrony thought she might be well satisfied.
      But she could not be satisfied with Colonel Heathcock, who, dressed in
      black, had stretched his 'fashionable length of limb' under the statira
      canopy upon the snow-white swan-down couch. When, after having monopolised
      attention, and been the subject of much bad wit, about black swans and
      rare birds, and swans being geese and geese being swans, the colonel
      condescended to rise, and, as Mrs. Dareville said, to vacate his couch,
      that couch was no longer white&#8212;the black impression of the colonel
      remained on the sullied snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh, now! really didn't recollect I was in black,' was all the apology he
      made. Lady Clonbrony was particularly vexed that the appearance of the
      statira, canopy should be spoiled before the effect had been seen by Lady
      Pococke, and Lady Chatterton, and Lady G&#8212;, Lady P&#8212;, and the
      Duke of V&#8212;, and a party of superlative fashionables, who had
      promised TO LOOK IN UPON HER, but who, late as it was, had not yet
      arrived. They came in at last. But Lady Clonbrony had no reason to regret
      for their sake the statira couch. It would have been lost upon them, as
      was everything else which she had prepared with so much pains and cost to
      excite their admiration, They came resolute not to admire. Skilled in the
      art of making others unhappy, they just looked round with an air of
      apathy. 'Ah! you've had Soho!&#8212;Soho has done wonders for you here!
      Vastly well!&#8212;Vastly well!&#8212;Soho's very clever in his way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Others of great importance came in, full of some slight accident that had
      happened to themselves, or their horses, or their carriages; and, with
      privileged selfishness, engrossed the attention of all within their sphere
      of conversation. Well, Lady Clonbrony got over all this, and got over the
      history of a letter about a chimney that was on fire, a week ago, at the
      Duke of V's old house, in Brecknockshire. In gratitude for the smiling
      patience with which she listened to him, his Grace of V&#8212;fixed his
      glass to look at the Alhambra, and had just pronounced it to be 'Well!&#8212;very
      well!' when the Dowager Lady Chatterton made a terrible discovery&#8212;a
      discovery that filled Lady Clonbrony with astonishment and indignation&#8212;Mr.
      Soho had played her false! What was her mortification when the dowager
      assured her that these identical Alhambra hangings had not only been shown
      by Mr. Soho to the Duchess of Torcaster, but that her grace had had the
      refusal of them, and had actually rejected them, in consequence of Sir
      Horace Grant the great traveller's objecting to some of the proportions of
      the pillars. Soho had engaged to make a new set, vastly improved, by Sir
      Horace's suggestions, for her Grace of Torcaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Lady Chatterton was the greatest talker extant; and she went about the
      rooms telling everybody of her acquaintance&#8212;and she was acquainted
      with everybody&#8212;how shamefully Soho had imposed upon poor Lady
      Clonbrony, protesting she could not forgive the man. 'For,' said she,'
      though the Duchess of Torcaster has been his constant customer for ages,
      and his patroness, and all that, yet this does not excuse him and Lady
      Clonbrony's being a stranger, and from Ireland, makes the thing worse.'
      From Ireland!&#8212;that was the unkindest cut of all but there was no
      remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain poor Lady Clonbrony followed the dowager about the rooms, to
      correct this mistake, and to represent, in justice to Mr. Soho, though he
      had used her so ill, that he knew she was an Englishwoman, The dowager was
      deaf, and no whisper could reach her ear. And when Lady Clonbrony was
      obliged to bawl an explanation in her car, the dowager only repeated&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'In justice to Mr. Soho!&#8212;No, no; he has not done you justice, my
      dear Lady Clonbrony! and I'll expose him to everybody. Englishwoman&#8212;no,
      no, no!&#8212;Soho could not take you for an Englishwoman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      All who secretly envied or ridiculed Lady Clonbrony enjoyed this scene.
      The Alhambra hangings, which had been, in one short hour before, the
      admiration of the world, were now regarded by every eye with contempt, as
      CAST hangings, and every tongue was busy declaiming against Mr. Soho;
      everybody declared that, from the first, the want of proportion had
      'struck them, but that they would not mention it till others found it
      out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      People usually revenge themselves for having admired too much, by
      afterwards despising and depreciating without mercy&#8212;in all great
      assemblies the perception of ridicule is quickly caught, and quickly too
      revealed. Lady Clonbrony, even in her own house, on her gala night, became
      an object of ridicule&#8212;decently masked, indeed, under the appearance
      of condolence with her ladyship, and of indignation against 'that
      abominable Mr. Soho!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Langdale, who was now, for reasons of her own, upon her good
      behaviour, did penance, as she said, for her former imprudence, by
      abstaining even from whispered sarcasms. She looked on with penitential
      gravity, said nothing herself, and endeavoured to keep Mrs. Dareville in
      order; but that was no easy task. Mrs. Dareville had no daughters, had
      nothing to gain from the acquaintance of my Lady Clonbrony; and, conscious
      that her ladyship would bear a vast deal from her presence, rather than
      forego the honour of her sanction, Mrs. Dareville, without any motives of
      interest, or good-nature of sufficient power to restrain her talent and
      habit of ridicule, free from hope or fear, gave full scope to all the
      malice of mockery, and all the insolence of fashion. Her slings and
      arrows, numerous as they were and outrageous, were directed against such
      petty objects, and the mischief was so quick, in its aim and its
      operation, that, felt but not seen, it is scarcely possible to register
      the hits, or to describe the nature of the wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hits sufficiently palpable, however, were recorded for the advantage
      of posterity. When Lady Clonbrony led her to look at the Chinese pagoda,
      the lady paused, with her foot on the threshold, as if afraid to enter
      this porcelain Elysium, as she called it&#8212;Fool's Paradise, she would
      have said; and, by her hesitation, and by the half-pronounced word,
      suggested the idea&#8212;'None but belles without petticoats can enter
      here,' said she, drawing her clothes tight round her; 'fortunately, I have
      but two, and Lady Langdale has but one.' Prevailed upon to venture in, she
      walked on with prodigious care and trepidation, affecting to be alarmed at
      the crowd of strange forms and monsters by which she was surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a creature here that I ever saw before in nature! Well, now I may
      boast I've been in a real Chinese pagoda!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why yes, everything is appropriate here, I flatter myself,' said Lady
      Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And how good of you, my dear Lady Clonbrony, in defiance of bulls and
      blunders, to allow us a comfortable English fireplace and plenty of
      Newcastle coal, in China!&#8212;And a white marble&#8212;no! white velvet
      hearthrug, painted with beautiful flowers&#8212;oh, the delicate, the
      USEFUL thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Vexed by the emphasis on the word USEFUL, Lady Clonbrony endeavoured to
      turn off the attention of the company. 'Lady Langdale, your ladyship's a
      judge of china&#8212;this vase is an unique, I am told.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am told,' interrupted Mrs. Dareville, 'this is the very vase in which B&#8212;,
      the nabob's father, who was, you know, a China captain, smuggled his dear
      little Chinese wife and all her fortune out of Canton&#8212;positively,
      actually put the lid on, packed her up, and sent her off on shipboard!&#8212;True!
      true! upon my veracity! I'll tell you my authority!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With this story Mrs. Dareville drew all attention from the jar, to Lady
      Clonbrony's infinite mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Langdale at length turned to look at a vast range of china jars.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ali Baba and the forty thieves!' exclaimed Mrs. Dareville; 'I hope you
      have boiling oil ready!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony was obliged to laugh, and to vow that Mrs. Dareville was
      uncommon pleasant to-night. 'But now,' said her ladyship, 'let me take you
      on to the Turkish tent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having with great difficulty got the malicious wit out of the pagoda and
      into the Turkish tent, Lady Clonbrony began to breathe more freely; for
      here she thought she was upon safe ground: 'Everything, I flatter myself'
      said she, 'is correct and appropriate, and quite picturesque.' The
      company, dispersed in happy groups, or reposing on seraglio ottomans,
      drinking lemonade and sherbet, beautiful Fatimas admiring, or being
      admired&#8212;'Everything here quite correct, appropriate, and
      picturesque,' repeated Mrs. Dareville.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady's powers as a mimic were extraordinary, and she found them
      irresistible. Hitherto she had imitated Lady Clonbrony's air and accent
      only behind her back; but, bolder grown, she now ventured, in spite of
      Lady Langdale's warning pinches, to mimic her kind hostess before her
      face, and to her face. Now, whenever Lady Clonbrony saw anything that
      struck her fancy in the dress of her fashionable friends, she had a way of
      hanging her head aside, and saying, with a peculiar sentimental drawl&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'How pretty!&#8212;how elegant! Now that quite suits my TEESTE! This
      phrase, precisely in the same accent, and with the head set to the same
      angle of affectation, Mrs. Dareville had the assurance to address to her
      ladyship, apropos to something which she pretended to admire in Lady
      Clonbrony's COSTUME&#8212;a costume which, excessively fashionable in each
      of its parts, was, all together, so extraordinarily unbecoming as to be
      fit for a print-shop. The perception of this, added to the effect of Mrs.
      Dareville's mimicry, was almost too much for Lady Langdale; she could not
      possibly have stood it, but for the appearance of Miss Nugent at this
      instant behind Lady Clonbrony. Grace gave one glance of indignation which
      seemed suddenly to strike Mrs. Dareville. Silence for a moment ensued, and
      afterwards the tone of the conversation was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Salisbury!&#8212;explain this to me,' said a lady, drawing Mr. Salisbury
      aside. 'If you are in the secret, do explain this to me; for unless I had
      seen it, I could not have believed it. Nay, though I have seen it, I do
      not believe it. How was that daring spirit laid? By what spell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the spell which superior minds always cast on inferior spirits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very fine,' said the lady, laughing, 'but as old as the days of Leonora
      de Galigai, quoted a million times. Now tell me something new and to the
      purpose, and better suited to modern days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, since you will not allow me to talk of superior minds in the
      present days, let me ask you if you have never observed that a wit, once
      conquered in company by a wit of a higher order, is thenceforward in
      complete subjection to the conqueror, whenever and wherever they meet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would not persuade me that yonder gentle-looking girl could ever be a
      match for the veteran Mrs. Dareville? She may have the wit, but has she
      the courage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; no one has more courage, more civil courage, where her own dignity,
      or the interests of her friends are concerned. I will tell you an instance
      or two to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow!&#8212;To-night!&#8212;tell it me now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a safe place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The safest in the world, in such a crowd as this. Follow my example. Take
      a glass of orgeat&#8212;sip from time to time, thus&#8212;speak low,
      looking innocent all the while straight forward, or now and then up at the
      lamps&#8212;keep on in an even tone&#8212;use no names&#8212;and you may
      tell anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, when Miss Nugent first came to London, Lady Langdale&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two names already&#8212;did not I warn ye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how can I make myself intelligible?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Initials&#8212;can't you use&#8212;or genealogy? What stops you?
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only Lord Colambre, a very safe person, I have a notion, when the
      eulogium is of Grace Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, who had now performed his arduous duties as a dancer, and
      had disembarrassed himself of all his partners, came into the Turkish tent
      just at this moment to refresh himself, and just in time to hear Mr.
      Salisbury's anecdotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady Langdale, you know, sets an inordinate value upon her curtsies in
      public, and she used to treat Miss Nugent, as her ladyship treats many
      other people, sometimes noticing, and sometimes pretending not to know
      her, according to the company she happened to be with. One day they met in
      some fine company&#8212;Lady Langdale looked as if she was afraid of
      committing herself by a curtsy. Miss Nugent waited for a good opportunity;
      and, when all the world was silent, leant forward, and called to Lady
      Langdale, as if she had something to communicate of the greatest
      consequence, skreening her whisper with her hand, as in an aside on the
      stage,&#8212;'Lady Langdale, you may curtsy to me now&#8212;nobody is
      looking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The retort courteous!' said Lord Colambre&#8212;'the only retort for a
      woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And her ladyship deserved it so well. But Mrs. Dareville, what happened
      about her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Dareville, you remember, some years ago, went to Ireland with some
      lady-lieutenant to whom she was related. There she was most hospitably
      received by Lord and Lady Clonbrony&#8212;went to their country house&#8212;was
      as intimate with Lady Clonbrony and with Miss Nugent as possible&#8212;stayed
      at Clonbrony Castle for a month; and yet, when Lady Clonbrony came to
      London, never took the least notice of her. At last, meeting at the house
      of a common friend, Mrs. Dareville could not avoid recognising her
      ladyship; but, even then, did it in the least civil manner and most
      cursory style possible. 'Ho! Lady Clonbrony!&#8212;didn't know you were in
      England!&#8212;When did you come?&#8212;How long shall you stay in town!&#8212;Hope,
      before you leave England, your Ladyship and Miss Nugent will give us a
      day?' A DAY!&#8212;Lady Clonbrony was so astonished by this impudence of
      ingratitude, that she hesitated how to TAKE IT; but Miss Nugent, quite
      coolly, and with a smile, answered, 'A DAY!&#8212;certainly&#8212;to you,
      who gave us a month!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Admirable! Now comprehend perfectly why Mrs. Dareville declines insulting
      Miss Nugent's friends in her presence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre said nothing, but thought much. 'How I wish my mother,'
      thought he, 'had some of Grace Nugent's proper pride! She would not then
      waste her fortune, spirits, health, and life, in courting such people as
      these.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen&#8212;he could not have borne to have beheld&#8212;the
      manner in which his mother had been treated by some of her guests; but he
      observed that she now looked harassed and vexed; and he was provoked and
      mortified by hearing her begging and beseeching some of these saucy
      leaders of the ton to oblige her, to do her the favour, to do her the
      honour, to stay to supper. It was just ready&#8212;actually announced.
      'No, they would not&#8212;they could not; they were obliged to run away&#8212;engaged
      to the Duchess of Torcaster.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre, what is the matter?' said Miss Nugent, going up to him, as
      he stood aloof and indignant: 'Don't look so like a chafed lion; others
      may perhaps read your countenance as well as I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None can read my mind so well,' replied he. 'Oh, my dear Grace!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Supper!&#8212;supper!' cried she; 'your duty to your neighbour, your hand
      to your partner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catharine, as they went downstairs to supper, observed that Miss
      Nugent had not been dancing, that she had kept quite in the background all
      night&#8212;quite in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those,' said Lord Colambre, 'who are contented in the shade are the best
      able to bear the light; and I am not surprised that one so interesting in
      the background should not desire to be the foremost figure in a piece.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper room, fitted up at great expense, with scenery to imitate
      Vauxhall, opened into a superb greenhouse, lighted with coloured lamps, a
      band of music at a distance&#8212;every delicacy, every luxury that could
      gratify the senses, appeared in profusion. The company ate and drank&#8212;enjoyed
      themselves&#8212;went away&#8212;and laughed at their hostess. Some,
      indeed, who thought they had been neglected, were in too bad humour to
      laugh, but abused her in sober earnest; for Lady Clonbrony had offended
      half, nay, three-quarters of her guests, by what they termed her exclusive
      attention to those very leaders of the ton, from whom she had suffered so
      much, and who had made it obvious to all that they thought they did her
      too much honour in appearing at her gala. So ended the gala for which she
      had lavished such sums; for which she had laboured so indefatigably; and
      from which she had expected such triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre, bid the musicians stop; they are playing to empty benches,'
      said Lady Clonbrony. 'Grace, my dear, will you see that these lamps are
      safely put out? I am so tired, so WORN OUT, I must go to bed; and I am
      sure I have caught cold too! What a NERVOUS BUSINESS it is to manage these
      things! I wonder how one gets through it, or WHY one does it!'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony was taken ill the day after her gala; she had caught cold
      by standing, when much overheated, in a violent draught of wind, paying
      her parting compliments to the Duke of V&#8212;, who thought her a bore,
      and wished her in heaven all the time for keeping his horses standing. Her
      ladyship's illness was severe and long; she was confined to her room for
      some weeks by a rheumatic fever, and an inflammation in her eyes. Every
      day, when Lord Colambre went to see his mother, he found Miss Nugent in
      her apartment, and every hour he found fresh reason to admire this
      charming girl. The affectionate tenderness, the indefatigable patience,
      the strong attachment she showed for her aunt, actually raised Lady
      Clonbrony in her son's opinion. He was persuaded she must surely have some
      good or great qualities, or she could not have excited such strong
      affection. A few foibles out of the question, such as her love of fine
      people, her affectation of being English, and other affectations too
      tedious to mention, Lady Clonbrony was really a good woman, had good
      principles, moral and religious, and, selfishness not immediately
      interfering, she was good-natured; and though her soul and attention were
      so completely absorbed in the duties of acquaintanceship that she did not
      know it, she really had affections&#8212;they were concentrated upon a few
      near relations. She was extremely fond and extremely proud of her son.
      Next to her son, she was fonder of her niece than of any other creature.
      She had received Grace Nugent into her family when she was left an orphan,
      and deserted by some of her other relations. She had bred her up, and had
      treated her with constant kindness. This kindness and these obligations
      had raised the warmest gratitude in Miss Nugent's heart; and it was the
      strong principle of gratitude which rendered her capable of endurance and
      exertions seemingly far above her strength. This young lady was not of a
      robust appearance, though she now underwent extraordinary fatigue. Her
      aunt could scarcely bear that she should leave her for a moment: she could
      not close her eyes unless Grace sat up with her many hours every night.
      Night after night she bore this fatigue; and yet, with little sleep or
      rest, she preserved her health, at least supported her spirits; and every
      morning, when Lord Colambre came into his mother's room, he saw Miss
      Nugent look as blooming as if she had enjoyed the most refreshing sleep.
      The bloom was, as he observed, not permanent; it came and went, with every
      emotion of her feeling heart; and he soon learned to fancy her almost as
      handsome when she was pale as when she had a colour. He had thought her
      beautiful when he beheld her in all the radiance of light, and with all
      the advantages of dress at the gala, but he found her infinitely more
      lovely and interesting now, when he saw her in a sick-room&#8212;a
      half-darkened chamber&#8212;where often he could but just discern her
      form, or distinguish her, except by her graceful motion as she passed, or
      when, but for a moment, a window-curtain drawn aside let the sun shine
      upon her face, or on the unadorned ringlets of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much must be allowed for an inflammation in the eyes, and something for a
      rheumatic fever; yet it may seem strange that Lady Clonbrony should be so
      blind and deaf as neither to see nor hear all this time; that, having
      lived so long in the world, it should never occur to her that it was
      rather imprudent to have a young lady, not eighteen, nursing her&#8212;and
      such a young lady!&#8212;when her son, not one-and-twenty&#8212;and such a
      son!&#8212;came to visit her daily. But, so it was. Lady Clonbrony knew
      nothing of love&#8212;she had read of it, indeed, in novels, which
      sometimes for fashion's sake she had looked at, and over which she had
      been obliged to doze; but this was only love in books&#8212;love in real
      life she had never met with&#8212;in the life she led, how should she? She
      had heard of its making young people, and old people even, do foolish
      things; but those were foolish people; and if they were worse than
      foolish, why it was shocking, and nobody visited them. But Lady Clonbrony
      had not, for her own part, the slightest, notion how people could be
      brought to this pass, nor how anybody out of Bedlam could prefer to a good
      house, a decent equipage, and a proper establishment, what is called love
      in a cottage. As to Colambre, she had too good an opinion of his
      understanding&#8212;to say nothing of his duty to his family, his pride,
      his rank, and his being her son&#8212;to let such an idea cross her
      imagination. As to her niece; in the first place, she was her niece, and
      first cousins should never marry, because they form no new connexions to
      strengthen the family interest, or raise its consequence. This doctrine
      her ladyship had repeated for years so often and so dogmatically, that she
      conceived it to be incontrovertible, and of as full force as any law of
      the land, or as any moral or religious obligation. She would as soon have
      suspected her niece of an intention of stealing her diamond necklace as of
      purloining Colambre's heart, or marrying this heir of the house of
      Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent was so well apprised, and so thoroughly convinced of all this,
      that she never for one moment allowed herself to think of Lord Colambre as
      a lover. Duty, honour, and gratitude&#8212;gratitude, the strong feeling
      and principle of her mind&#8212;forbade it; she had so prepared and
      habituated herself to consider him as a person with whom she could not
      possibly be united that, with perfect ease and simplicity, she behaved
      towards him exactly as if he was her brother&#8212;not in the equivocating
      sentimental romance style in which ladies talk of treating men as their
      brothers, whom they are all the time secretly thinking of and endeavouring
      to please as lovers&#8212;not using this phrase as a convenient pretence,
      a safe mode of securing herself from suspicion or scandal, and of enjoying
      the advantages of confidence and the intimacy of friendship, till the
      propitious moment, when it should be time to declare or avow THE SECRET OF
      THE HEART. No; this young lady was quite above all double-dealing; she had
      no mental reservation&#8212;no metaphysical subtleties&#8212;but, with
      plain, unsophisticated morality, in good faith and simple truth, acted as
      she professed, thought what she said, and was that which she seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Lady Clonbrony was able to see anybody, her niece sent to Mrs.
      Broadhurst, who was very intimate with the family; she used to come
      frequently, almost every evening, to sit with the invalid. Miss Broadhurst
      accompanied her mother, for she did not like to go out with any other
      chaperon&#8212;it was disagreeable to spend her time alone at home, and
      most agreeable to spend it with her friend Miss Nugent. In this she had no
      design, no coquetry; Miss Broadhurst had too lofty and independent a
      spirit to stoop to coquetry: she thought that, in their interview at the
      gala, she understood Lord Colambre, and that he understood her&#8212;that
      he was not inclined to court her for her fortune&#8212;that she would not
      be content with any suitor who was not a lover. She was two or three years
      older than Lord Colambre, perfectly aware of her want of beauty, yet with
      a just sense of her own merit, and of what was becoming and due to the
      dignity of her sex. This, she trusted, was visible in her manners, and
      established in Lord Colambre's mind; so that she ran no risk of being
      misunderstood by him; and as to what the rest of the world thought, she
      was so well used to hear weekly and daily reports of her going to be
      married to fifty different people, that she cared little for what was said
      on this subject. Indeed, conscious of rectitude, and with an utter
      contempt for mean and commonplace gossiping, she was, for a woman, and a
      young woman, rather too disdainful of the opinion of the world. Mrs.
      Broadhurst, though her daughter had fully explained herself respecting
      Lord Colambre, before she began this course of visiting, yet rejoiced
      that, even on this footing, there should be constant intercourse between
      them. It was Mrs. Broadhurst's warmest wish that her daughter should
      obtain rank, and connect herself with an ancient family: she was sensible
      that the young lady's being older than the gentleman might be an obstacle;
      and very sorry she was to find that her daughter had so imprudently, so
      unnecessarily, declared her age; but still this little obstacle might be
      overcome; much greater difficulties in the marriage of inferior heiresses
      were every day got over, and thought nothing of. Then, as to the young
      lady's own sentiments, her mother knew them better than she did herself;
      she understood her daughter's pride, that she dreaded to be made an object
      of bargain and sale; but Mrs. Broadhurst, who, with all her coarseness of
      mind, had rather a better notion of love matters than Lady Clonbrony,
      perceived, through her daughter's horror of being offered to Lord
      Colambre, through her anxiety that nothing approaching to an advance on
      the part of her family should be made, that if Lord Colambre should
      himself advance, he would stand a better chance of being accepted than any
      other of the numerous persons who had yet aspired to the favour of this
      heiress. The very circumstance of his having paid no court to her at
      first, operated in his favour; for it proved that he was not mercenary,
      and that, whatever attention he might afterwards show, she must be sure
      would be sincere and disinterested.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now, let them but see one another in this easy, intimate kind of way,
      and you will find, my dear Lady Clonbrony, things will go on of their own
      accord, all the better for our&#8212;minding our cards&#8212;and never
      minding anything else. I remember, when I was young&#8212;but let that
      pass&#8212;let the young people see one another, and manage their own
      affairs their own way&#8212;let them be together&#8212;that's all I say.
      Ask half the men you are acquainted with why they married, and their
      answer, if they speak truth, will be: "Because I met Miss such-a-one at
      such a place, and we were continually together." Propinquity! propinquity!&#8212;as
      my father used to say&#8212;and he was married five times, and twice to
      heiresses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this plan of leaving things to themselves, every evening
      Lady Clonbrony made out her own little card-table with Mrs. Broadhurst,
      and a Mr. and Miss Pratt, a brother and sister, who were the most
      obliging, convenient neighbours imaginable. From time to time, as Lady
      Clonbrony gathered up her cards, she would direct an inquiring glance to
      the group of young people at the other table; whilst the more prudent Mrs.
      Broadhurst sat plump with her back to them, pursing up her lips, and
      contracting her brows in token of deep calculation, looking down
      impenetrable at her cards, never even noticing Lady Clonbrony's glances,
      but inquiring from her partner, 'How many they were by honours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young party generally consisted of Miss Broadhurst, Lord Colambre,
      Miss Nugent, and her admirer, Mr. Salisbury. Mr. Salisbury was a
      middle-aged gentleman, very agreeable, and well informed; he had
      travelled; had seen a great deal of the world; had lived in the best
      company; had acquired what is called good TACT; was full of anecdote, not
      mere gossiping anecdotes that lead to nothing, but anecdotes
      characteristic of national manners, of human nature in general, or of
      those illustrious individuals who excite public curiosity and interest.
      Miss Nugent had seen him always in large companies, where he was admired
      for his SCAVOIR-VIVRE, and for his entertaining anecdotes, but where he
      had no opportunity of producing any of the higher powers of his
      understanding, or showing character. She found that Mr. Salisbury appeared
      to her quite a different person when conversing with Lord Colambre. Lord
      Colambre, with that ardent thirst for knowledge which it is always
      agreeable to gratify, had an air of openness and generosity, a frankness,
      a warmth of manner, which, with good breeding, but with something beyond
      it and superior to its established forms, irresistibly won the confidence
      and attracted the affection of those with whom he conversed. His manners
      were peculiarly agreeable to a person like Mr. Salisbury, tired of the
      sameness and egotism of men of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent had seldom till now had the advantage of hearing much
      conversation on literary subjects. In the life she had been compelled to
      lead she had acquired accomplishments, had exercised her understanding
      upon everything that passed before her, and from circumstances had formed
      her judgment and her taste by observations on real life; but the ample
      page of knowledge had never been unrolled to her eyes. She had never had
      opportunities of acquiring literature herself, but she admired it in
      others, particularly in her friend Miss Broadhurst. Miss Broadhurst had
      received all the advantages of education which money could procure, and
      had profited by them in a manner uncommon among those for whom they are
      purchased in such abundance; she not only had had many masters, and read
      many books, but had thought of what she read, and had supplied, by the
      strength and energy of her own mind, what cannot be acquired by the
      assistance of masters. Miss Nugent, perhaps overvaluing the information
      that she did not possess, and free from all idea of envy, looked up to her
      friend as to a superior being, with a sort of enthusiastic admiration; and
      now, with 'charmed attention,' listened, by turns, to her, to Mr.
      Salisbury, and to Lord Colambre, whilst they conversed on literary
      subjects&#8212;listened, with a countenance so full of intelligence, of
      animation so expressive of every good and kind affection, that the
      gentlemen did not always know what they were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray go on,' said she, once, to Mr. Salisbury; 'you stop, perhaps, from
      politeness to me&#8212;from compassion to my ignorance; but, though I am
      ignorant, you do not tire me, I assure you. Did you ever condescend to
      read the Arabian tales? Like him whose eyes were touched by the magical
      application from the dervise, I am enabled at once to see the riches of a
      new world&#8212;Oh! how unlike, how superior to that in which I have
      lived!&#8212;the GREAT world, as it is called.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre brought down a beautiful edition of the Arabian tales,
      looked for the story to which Miss Nugent had alluded, and showed it to
      Miss Broadhurst, who was also searching for it in another volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony, from her card-table, saw the young people thus engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I profess not to understand these things so well as you say you do, my
      dear Mrs. Broadhurst,' whispered she; 'but look there now; they are at
      their books! What do you expect can come of that sort of thing? So
      ill-bred, and downright rude of Colambre, I must give him a hint.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, for mercy's sake! my dear Lady Clonbrony, no hints, no hints, no
      remarks! What would you have!&#8212;she reading, and my lord at the back
      of her chair, leaning over&#8212;and allowed, mind, to lean over to read
      the same thing. Can't be better! Never saw any man yet allowed to come so
      near her! Now, Lady Clonbrony, not a word, not a look, I beseech.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well!&#8212;but if they had a little music.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My daughter's tired of music. How much do I owe your ladyship now?&#8212;three
      rubbers, I think. Now, though you would not believe it of a young girl,'
      continued Mrs. Broadhurst, 'I can assure your ladyship, my daughter would
      often rather go to a book than a ball.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, now, that's very extraordinary, in the style in which she has been
      brought up; yet books and all that are so fashionable now, that it's very
      natural,' said Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, Mr. Berryl, Lord Colambre's Cambridge friend, for whom
      his lordship had fought the battle of the curricle with Mordicai, came to
      town. Lord Colambre introduced him to his mother, by whom he was
      graciously received; for Mr. Berryl was a young gentleman of good figure,
      good address, good family, heir to a good fortune, and in every respect a
      fit match for Miss Nugent. Lady Clonbrony thought that it would be wise to
      secure him for her niece before he should make his appearance in the
      London world, where mothers and daughters would soon make him feel his own
      consequence. Mr. Berryl, as Lord Colambre's intimate friend, was admitted
      to the private evening parties at Lady Clonbrony's, and he contributed to
      render them still more agreeable. His information, his habits of thinking,
      and his views, were all totally different from Mr. Salisbury's; and their
      collision continually struck out that sparkling novelty which pleases
      peculiarly in conversation. Mr. Berryl's education, disposition, and
      tastes, fitted him exactly for the station which he was destined to fill
      in society&#8212;that of a COUNTRY GENTLEMAN; not meaning by that
      expression a mere eating, drinking, hunting, shooting, ignorant country
      squire of the old race, which is now nearly extinct; but a cultivated,
      enlightened, independent English country gentleman&#8212;the happiest,
      perhaps, of human beings. On the comparative felicity of the town and
      country life; on the dignity, utility, elegance, and interesting nature of
      their different occupations, and general scheme of passing their time, Mr.
      Berryl and Mr. Salisbury had one evening a playful, entertaining, and,
      perhaps, instructive conversation; each party, at the end, remaining, as
      frequently happens, of their own opinion. It was observed that Miss
      Broadhurst ably and warmly defended Mr. Berryl's side of the question; and
      in their views, plans, and estimates of life, there appeared a remarkable,
      and as Lord Colambre thought, a happy coincidence. When she was at last
      called upon to give her decisive judgment between a town and a country
      life, she declared that 'if she were condemned to the extremes of either,
      she should prefer a country life, as much as she should prefer Robinson
      Crusoe's diary to the journal of the idle man in the SPECTATOR.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord bless me! Mrs. Broadhurst, do you hear what your daughter is
      saying?' cried Lady Clonbrony, who, from the card-table, lent an attentive
      ear to all that was going forward. 'Is it possible that Miss Broadhurst,
      with her fortune, and pretensions, and sense, can really be serious in
      saying she would be content to live in the country?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that you say, child, about living in the country?' said Mrs.
      Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Broadhurst repeated what she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Girls always think so who have lived in town,' said Mrs. Broadhurst.
      'They are always dreaming of sheep and sheephooks; but the first winter
      the country cures them; a shepherdess, in winter, is a sad and sorry sort
      of personage, except at a masquerade.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'I am sure Miss Broadhurst's sentiments
      about town life, and all that, must delight you; for do you know, ma'am,
      he is always trying to persuade me to give up living in town? Colambre and
      Miss Broadhurst perfectly agree.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mind your cards, my dear Lady Clonbrony,' interrupted Mrs. Broadhurst,
      'in pity to your partner. Mr. Pratt has certainly the patience of Job&#8212;your
      ladyship has revoked twice this hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony begged a thousand pardons, fixed her eyes and endeavoured
      to fix her mind on the cards; but there was something said at the other
      end of the room, about an estate in Cambridgeshire, which soon distracted
      her attention again. Mr. Pratt certainly had the patience of Job. She
      revoked, and lost the game, though they had four by honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she rose from the card-table, and could speak to Mrs.
      Broadhurst apart, she communicated her apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seriously, my dear madam,' said she, 'I believe I have done very wrong to
      admit Mr. Berryl just now, though it was on Grace's account I did it. But,
      ma'am, I did not know Miss Broadhurst had an estate in Cambridgeshire;
      their two estates just close to one another, I heard them say. Lord bless
      me, ma'am! there's the danger of propinquity indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No danger, no danger,' persisted Mrs. Broadhurst. 'I know my girl better
      than you do, begging your ladyship's pardon. No one thinks less of estates
      than she does.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I only know I heard her talking of them, and earnestly too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, very likely; but don't you know that girls never think of what they
      are talking about, or rather never talk of what they are thinking about?
      And they have always ten times more to say to the man they don't care for,
      than to him they do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very extraordinary!' said Lady Clonbrony. 'I only hope you are right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure of it,' said Mrs. Broadhurst. 'Only let things go on, and mind
      your cards, I beseech you, to-morrow night better than you did to-night;
      and you will see that things will turn out just as I prophesied. Lord
      Colambre will come to a point-blank proposal before the end of the week,
      and will be accepted, or my name's not Broadhurst. Why, in plain English,
      I am clear my girl likes him; and when that's the case, you know, can you
      doubt how the thing will end?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Broadhurst was perfectly right in every point of her reasoning but
      one. From long habit of seeing and considering that such an heiress as her
      daughter might marry whom she pleased&#8212;from constantly seeing that
      she was the person to decide and to reject&#8212;Mrs. Broadhurst had
      literally taken it for granted that everything was to depend upon her
      daughter's inclinations: she was not mistaken, in the present case, in
      opining that the young lady would not be averse to Lord Colambre, if he
      came to what she called a point-blank proposal. It really never occurred
      to Mrs. Broadhurst that any man, whom her daughter was the least inclined
      to favour, could think of anybody else. Quick-sighted in these affairs as
      the matron thought herself, she saw but one side of the question: blind
      and dull of comprehension as she thought Lady Clonbrony on this subject,
      she was herself so completely blinded by her own prejudices, as to be
      incapable of discerning the plain thing that was before her eyes;
      VIDELICET, that Lord Colambre preferred Grace Nugent. Lord Colambre made
      no proposal before the end of the week, but this Mrs. Broadhurst
      attributed to an unexpected occurrence, which prevented things from going
      on in the train in which they had been proceeding so smoothly. Sir John
      Berryl, Mr. Berryl's father, was suddenly seized with a dangerous illness.
      The news was brought to Mr. Berryl one evening whilst he was at Lady
      Clonbrony's. The circumstances of domestic distress, which afterwards
      occurred in the family of his friend, entirely occupied Lord Colambre's
      time and attention. All thoughts of love were suspended, and his whole
      mind was given up to the active services of friendship. The sudden illness
      of Sir John Berryl spread an alarm among his creditors which brought to
      light at once the disorder of his affairs, of which his son had no
      knowledge or suspicion. Lady Berryl had been a very expensive woman,
      especially in equipages; and Mordicai, the coachmaker, appeared at this
      time the foremost and the most inexorable of their creditors. Conscious
      that the charges in his account were exorbitant, and that they would not
      be allowed if examined by a court of justice; that it was a debt which
      only ignorance and extravagance could have in the first instance incurred,
      swelled afterwards to an amazing amount by interest, and interest upon
      interest; Mordicai was impatient to obtain payment whilst Sir John yet
      lived, or at least to obtain legal security for the whole sum from the
      heir. Mr. Berryl offered his bond for the amount of the reasonable charges
      in his account; but this Mordicai absolutely refused, declaring that now
      he had the power in his own hands, he would use it to obtain the utmost
      penny of his debt; that he would not let the thing slip through his
      fingers; that a debtor never yet escaped him, and never should; that a
      man's lying upon his deathbed was no excuse to a creditor; that he was not
      a whiffler, to stand upon ceremony about disturbing a gentleman in his
      last moments; that he was not to be cheated out of his due by such
      niceties; that he was prepared to go all lengths the law would allow; for
      that, as to what people said of him, he did not care a doit&#8212;'Cover
      your face with your hands, if you like it, Mr. Berryl; you may be ashamed
      for me, but I feel no shame for myself&#8212;I am not so weak.' Mordicai's
      countenance said more than his words; livid with malice, and with
      atrocious determination in his eyes, he stood. 'Yes, sir,' said he, 'you
      may look at me as you please&#8212;it is possible I am in earnest. Consult
      what you'll do now, behind my back or before my face, it comes to the same
      thing; for nothing will do but my money or your bond, Mr. Berryl. The
      arrest is made on the person of your father, luckily made while the breath
      is still in the body. Yes&#8212;start forward to strike me, if you dare&#8212;your
      father, Sir John Berryl, sick or well, is my prisoner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Berryl and Mr. Berryl's sisters, in an agony of grief, rushed into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all useless,' cried Mordicai, turning his back upon the ladies;
      'these tricks upon creditors won't do with me; I'm used to these scenes;
      I'm not made of such stuff as you think. Leave a gentleman in peace in his
      last moments. No! he ought not, nor shan't die in peace, if he don't pay
      his debts; and if you are all so mighty sorry, ladies, there's the
      gentleman you may kneel to; if tenderness is the order of the day, it's
      for the son to show it, not me. Ay, now, Mr. Berryl,' cried he, as Mr.
      Berryl took up the bond to sign it, 'you're beginning to know I'm not a
      fool to be trifled with. Stop your hand, if you choose it, sir&#8212;it's
      all the same to me; the person, or the money, I'll carry with me out of
      this house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beryl signed the bond, and threw it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, monster!&#8212;quit the house!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Monster is not actionable&#8212;I wish you had called me rascal,' said
      Mordicai, grinning a horrible smile; and taking up the bond deliberately,
      returned it to Mr. Berryl. 'This paper is worth nothing to me, sir&#8212;it
      is not witnessed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Berryl hastily left the room, and returned with Lord Colambre.
      Mordicai changed countenance and grew pale, for a moment, at sight of Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my lord, since it so happens, I am not sorry that you should be
      witness to this paper,' said, he; 'and indeed not sorry that you should
      witness the whole proceeding; for I trust I shall be able to explain to
      you my conduct.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not come here, sir,' interrupted Lord Colambre, 'to listen to any
      explanations of your conduct, which I perfectly understand;&#8212;I come
      to witness a bond for my friend Mr. Berryl, if you think proper to extort
      from him such a bond.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I extort nothing, my lord. Mr. Berryl, it is quite a voluntary act, take
      notice, on your part; sign or not, witness or not, as you please,
      gentlemen,' said Mordicai, sticking his hands in his pockets, and
      recovering his look of black and fixed determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Witness it, witness it, my dear lord,' said Mr. Berryl, looking at his
      mother and weeping sisters; 'witness it, quick!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Berryl must just run over his name again in your presence, my lord,
      with a dry pen,' said Mordicai, putting the pen into Mr. Berryl's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir,' said Lord Colambre, 'my friend shall never sign it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As you please, my lord&#8212;the bond or the body, before I quit this
      house,' said Mordicai.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neither, sir, shall you have; and you quit this house directly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How! how!&#8212;my lord, how's this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir, the arrest you have made is as illegal as it is inhuman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Illegal, my lord!' said Mordicai, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Illegal, sir. I came into this house at the moment when your bailiff
      asked and was refused admittance. Afterwards, in the confusion of the
      family above stairs, he forced open the house door with an iron bar&#8212;I
      saw him&#8212;I am ready to give evidence of the fact. Now proceed at your
      peril.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai, without reply snatched up his hat, and walked towards the door;
      but Lord Colambre held the door open&#8212;the door was immediately at the
      head of the stairs&#8212;and Mordicai, seeing his indignant look and proud
      form, hesitated to pass; for he had always heard that Irishmen are 'quick
      in the executive part of justice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pass on, sir,' repeated Lord Colambre, with an air of ineffable contempt;
      'I am a gentleman&#8212;you have nothing to fear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordicai ran downstairs; Lord Colambre, before he went back into the room,
      waited to see Mordicai and his bailiff out of the house. When Mordicai was
      fairly at the bottom of the stairs, he turned, and, white with rage,
      looked up at Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charity begins at home, my lord,' said he. 'Look at home&#8212;you shall
      pay for this,' added he, standing half-shielded by the house door, for
      Lord Colambre moved forward as he spoke the last words; 'and I give you
      this warning, because I know it will be of no use to you&#8212;Your most
      obedient, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The house door closed after Mordicai.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank Heaven!' thought Lord Colambre, 'that I did not horsewhip that mean
      wretch! This warning shall be of use to me. But it is not time to think of
      that yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre turned from his own affairs to those of his friend, to offer
      all the assistance and consolation in his power. Sir John Berryl died that
      night. His daughters, who had lived in the highest style in London, were
      left totally unprovided for. His widow had mortgaged her jointure. Mr.
      Berryl had an estate now left to him, but without any income. He could not
      be so dishonest as to refuse to pay his father's just debts; he could not
      let his mother and sisters starve. The scene of distress to which Lord
      Colambre was witness in this family made a still greater impression upon
      him than had been made by the warning or the threats of Mordicai. The
      similarity between the circumstances of his friend's family and of his own
      struck him forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this evil had arisen from Lady Berryl's passion for living in London
      and at watering-places. She had made her husband an ABSENTEE&#8212;an
      absentee from his home, his affairs, his duties, and his estate. The sea,
      the Irish Channel, did not, indeed, flow between him and his estate; but
      it was of little importance whether the separation was effected by land or
      water&#8212;the consequences, the negligence, the extravagance, were the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the few people of his age who are capable of profiting by the
      experience of others, Lord Colambre was one. 'Experience,' as an elegant
      writer has observed, 'is an article that may be borrowed with safety, and
      is often dearly bought.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Lady Clonbrony had been occupied with thoughts very
      different from those which passed in the mind of her son. Though she had
      never completely recovered from her rheumatic pains, she had become
      inordinately impatient of confinement to her own house, and weary of those
      dull evenings at home, which had, in her son's absence, become
      insupportable. She told over her visiting tickets regularly twice a day,
      and gave to every card of invitation a heartfelt sigh. Miss Pratt alarmed
      her ladyship, by bringing intelligence of some parties given by persons of
      consequence, to which she was not invited. She feared that she should be
      forgotten in the world, well knowing how soon the world forgets those they
      do not see every day and everywhere. How miserable is the fine lady's lot
      who cannot forget the world, and who is forgot by the world in a moment!
      How much more miserable still is the condition of a would-be fine lady,
      working her way up in the world with care and pains! By her, every the
      slightest failure of attention, from persons of rank and fashion, is
      marked and felt with jealous anxiety, and with a sense of mortification
      the most acute&#8212;an invitation omitted is a matter of the most serious
      consequence, not only as it regards the present, but the future; for if
      she be not invited by Lady A, it will lower her in the eyes of Lady B, and
      of all the ladies of the alphabet. It will form a precedent of the most
      dangerous and inevitable application. If she has nine invitations, and the
      tenth be wanting, the nine have no power to make her happy. This was
      precisely Lady Clonbrony's case&#8212;there was to be a party at Lady St.
      James's, for which Lady Clonbrony had no card.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So ungrateful, so monstrous, of Lady St. James!&#8212;What! was the gala
      so soon forgotten, and all the marked attentions paid that night to Lady
      St. James!&#8212;attentions, you know, Pratt, which were looked upon with
      a jealous eye, and made me enemies enough, I am told, in another quarter!
      Of all people, I did not expect to be slighted by Lady St. James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pratt, who was ever ready to undertake the defence of any person who
      had a title, pleaded, in mitigation of censure, that perhaps Lady St.
      James might not be aware that her ladyship was yet well enough to venture
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear Miss Pratt, that cannot be the thing; for, in spite of my
      rheumatism, which really was bad enough last Sunday, I went on purpose to
      the Royal Chapel, to show myself in the closet, and knelt close to her
      ladyship. And, my dear, we curtsied, and she congratulated me, after
      church, upon my being abroad again, and was so happy to see me look so
      well, and all that&#8212;Oh! it is something very extraordinary and
      unaccountable!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, I daresay, a card will come yet,' said Miss Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this hint, Lady Clonbrony's hope revived; and, staying her anger, she
      began to consider how she could manage to get herself invited. Refreshing
      tickets were left next morning at Lady St. James's with their corners
      properly turned up; to do the thing better, separate tickets for herself
      and for Miss Nugent were left for each member of the family; and her civil
      messages, left with the footman, extended to the utmost possibility of
      remainder. It had occurred to her ladyship that for Miss Somebody, THE
      COMPANION, of whom she had never in her life thought before, she had
      omitted to leave a card last time, and she now left a note of explanation;
      she further, with her rheumatic head and arm out of the coach-window, sat,
      the wind blowing keen upon her, explaining to the porter and the footman,
      to discover whether her former tickets had gone safely up to Lady St.
      James; and on the present occasion, to make assurance doubly sure, she
      slid handsome expedition money into the servant's hand&#8212;'Sir, you
      will be sure to remember.'&#8212;'Oh certainly, your ladyship!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She well knew what dire offence has frequently been taken, what sad
      disasters have occurred, in the fashionable world, from the neglect of a
      porter in delivering, or of a footman in carrying up one of those
      talismanic cards. But, in spite of all her manoeuvres, no invitation to
      the party arrived next day. Pratt was next set to work. Miss Pratt was a
      most convenient go-between, who, in consequence of doing a thousand little
      services, to which few others of her rank in life would stoop, had
      obtained the ENTREE to a number of great houses, and was behind the scenes
      in many fashionable families. Pratt could find out, and Pratt could hint,
      and Pratt could manage to get things done cleverly&#8212;and hints were
      given, in all directions, to WORK ROUND to Lady St. James. But still they
      did not take effect. At last Pratt suggested that, perhaps, though
      everything else had failed, dried salmon might be tried with success. Lord
      Clonbrony had just had some uncommonly good from Ireland, which Pratt knew
      Lady St. James would like to have at her supper, because a certain
      personage, whom she would not name, was particularly fond of it.&#8212;Wheel
      within wheel in the fine world, as well as in the political world!&#8212;Bribes
      for all occasions, and for all ranks! The timely present was sent,
      accepted with many thanks, and understood as it was meant. Per favour of
      this propitiatory offering, and of a promise of half a dozen pair of real
      Limerick gloves to Miss Pratt&#8212;a promise which Pratt clearly
      comprehended to be a conditional promise&#8212;the grand object was at
      length accomplished. The very day before the party was to take place came
      cards of invitation to Lady Clonbrony and to Miss Nugent, with Lady St.
      James's apologies; her ladyship was concerned to find that, by some
      negligence of her servants, these cards were not sent in proper time. 'How
      slight an apology will do from some people!' thought Miss Nugent; 'how
      eager to forgive, when it is for our interest or our pleasure; how well
      people act the being deceived, even when all parties know that they see
      the whole truth; and how low pride will stoop to gain its object!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed of the whole transaction, Miss Nugent earnestly wished that a
      refusal should be sent, and reminded her aunt of her rheumatism; but
      rheumatism and all other objections were overruled&#8212;Lady Clonbrony
      would go. It was just when this affair was thus, in her opinion,
      successfully settled, that Lord Colambre came in, with a countenance of
      unusual seriousness, his mind full of the melancholy scenes he had
      witnessed in his friend's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the matter; Colambre?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He related what had passed; he described the brutal conduct of Mordicai;
      the anguish of the mother and sisters; the distress of Mr. Berryl. Tears
      rolled down Miss Nugent's cheeks. Lady Clonbrony declared it was very
      shocking; listened with attention to all the particulars; but never failed
      to correct her son, whenever he said Mr. Berryl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir ARTHUR Berryl, you mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, however, really touched with compassion when he spoke of Lady
      Berryl's destitute condition; and her son was going on to repeat what
      Mordicai had said to him, but Lady Clonbrony interrupted&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear Colambre! don't repeat that detestable man's impertinent
      speeches to me. If there is anything really about business, speak to your
      father. At any rate, don't tell us of it now, because I've a hundred
      things to do,' said her ladyship, hurrying out of the room, 'Grace&#8212;Grace
      Nugent! I want you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't despair,' said Miss Nugent, as she followed to obey her aunt's
      summons. 'Don't despair; don't attempt to speak to her again till
      to-morrow morning. Her head is now full of Lady St. James's party. When it
      is emptied of that, you will have a better chance. Never despair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, while you encourage me to hope&#8212;that any good can be done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony was particularly glad that she had carried her point about
      this party at Lady St. James's; because, from the first private intimation
      that the Duchess of Torcaster was to be there, her ladyship flattered
      herself that the long-desired introduction might then be accomplished. But
      of this hope Lady St. James had likewise received intimation from the
      double-dealing Miss Pratt; and a warning note was despatched to the
      duchess to let her grace know that circumstances had occurred which had
      rendered it impossible not to ask THE CLONBRONIES. An excuse, of course,
      for not going to this party was sent by the duchess&#8212;her grace did
      not like large parties&#8212;she would have the pleasure of accepting Lady
      St. James's invitation for her select party on Wednesday the 10th. Into
      these select parties Lady Clonbrony had never been admitted. In return for
      her great entertainments she was invited to great entertainments, to large
      parties; but farther she could never penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Lady St, James's, and with her set, Lady Clonbrony suffered a different
      kind of mortification from that which Lady Langdale and Mrs. Dareville
      made her endure. She was safe from the witty raillery, the sly innuendo,
      the insolent mimicry; but she was kept at a cold, impassable distance, by
      ceremony&#8212;'So far shalt thou go, and no farther' was expressed in
      every look, in every word, and in a thousand different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the most punctilious respect and nice regard to precedency, even by
      words of courtesy&#8212;'Your ladyship does me honour,' etc.&#8212;Lady
      St. James contrived to mortify and to mark the difference between those
      with whom she was, and with whom she was not, upon terms of intimacy and
      equality. Thus the ancient grandees of Spain drew a line of demarcation
      between themselves and the newly-created nobility. Whenever or wherever
      they met, they treated the new nobles with the utmost respect, never
      addressed them but with all their titles, with low bows, and with all the
      appearance of being, with the most perfect consideration, anything but
      their equals; whilst towards one another the grandees laid aside their
      state, and omitting their titles, it was,
      'Alcala-Medina-Sidonia-Infantado,' and a freedom and familiarity which
      marked equality. Entrenched in etiquette in this manner, and mocked with
      marks of respect, it was impossible either to intrude or to complain of
      being excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper at Lady St. James's, Lady Clonbrony's present was pronounced by
      some gentleman to be remarkably high flavoured. This observation turned
      the conversation to Irish commodities and Ireland. Lady Clonbrony,
      possessed by the idea that it was disadvantageous to appear as an
      Irishwoman, or as a favourer of Ireland, began to be embarrassed by Lady
      St. James's repeated thanks. Had it been in her power to offer anything
      else with propriety, she would not have thought of sending her ladyship
      anything from Ireland. Vexed by the questions that were asked her about
      HER COUNTRY, Lady Clonbrony, as usual, denied it to be her country, and
      went on to depreciate and abuse everything Irish; to declare that there
      was no possibility of living in Ireland; and that, for her own part, she
      was resolved never to return thither. Lady St. James, preserving perfect
      silence, let her go on. Lady Clonbrony, imagining that this silence arose
      from coincidence of opinion, proceeded with all the eloquence she
      possessed, which was very little, repeating the same exclamations, and
      reiterating her vow of perpetual expatriation; till at last an elderly
      lady, who was a stranger to her, and whom she had till this moment
      scarcely noticed, took up the defence of Ireland with much warmth and
      energy: the eloquence with which she spoke, and the respect with which she
      was heard, astonished Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is she?' whispered her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does not your ladyship know Lady Oranmore&#8212;the Irish Lady Oranmore?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord bless me!&#8212;what have I said!&#8212;what have I done! Oh! why
      did not you give me a hint, Lady St. James?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was not aware that your ladyship was not acquainted with Lady
      Oranmore,' replied Lady St. James, unmoved by her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody sympathised with Lady Oranmore, and admired the honest zeal with
      which she abided by her country, and defended it against unjust aspersions
      and affected execrations. Every one present enjoyed Lady Clonbrony's
      confusion, except Miss Nugent, who sat with her eyes bowed down by
      penetrative shame during the whole of this scene; she was glad that Lord
      Colambre was not witness to it; and comforted herself with the hope that,
      upon the whole, Lady Clonbrony would be benefited by the pain she had
      felt. This instance might convince her that it was not necessary to deny
      her country to be received in any company in England; and that those who
      have the courage and steadiness to be themselves, and to support what they
      feel and believe to be the truth, must command respect. Miss Nugent hoped
      that in consequence of this conviction Lady Clonbrony would lay aside the
      little affectations by which her manners were painfully constrained and
      ridiculous; and, above all, she hoped that what Lady Oranmore had said of
      Ireland might dispose her aunt to listen with patience to all Lord
      Colambre might urge in favour of returning to her home. But Miss Nugent
      hoped in vain. Lady Clonbrony never in her life generalised any
      observations, or drew any but a partial conclusion from the most striking
      facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord! my dear Grace!' said she, as soon as they were seated in their
      carriage, 'what a scrape I got into to-night at supper, and what disgrace
      I came to!&#8212;and all this because I did not know Lady Oranmore. Now
      you see the inconceivable disadvantage of not knowing everybody&#8212;everybody
      of a certain rank, of course, I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent endeavoured to slide in her own moral on the occasion, but it
      would not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my dear, Lady Oranmore may talk in that kind of style of Ireland,
      because, on the other hand, she is so highly connected in England; and,
      besides, she is an old lady, and may take liberties; in short, she is Lady
      Oranmore, and that's enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when they all met at breakfast, Lady Clonbrony
      complained bitterly of her increased rheumatism, of the disagreeable,
      stupid party they had had the preceding night, and of the necessity of
      going to another formal party that night, the next, and the next, and, in
      the true fine lady style, deplored her situation, and the impossibility of
      avoiding those things,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Which felt they curse, yet covet still to feel.<br /></pre>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent determined to retire as soon as she could from the
      breakfast-room, to leave Lord Colambre an opportunity of talking over his
      family affairs at full liberty. She knew by the seriousness of his
      countenance that his mind was intent upon doing so, and she hoped that his
      influence with his father and mother would not be exerted in vain. But
      just as she was rising from the breakfast-table, in came Sir Terence
      O'Fay, and, seating himself quite at his ease, in spite of Lady
      Clonbrony's repulsive looks, his awe of Lord Colambre having now worn off&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm tired,' said he, 'and have a right to be tired; for it's no small
      walk I've taken for the good of this noble family this morning. And, Miss
      Nugent, before I say more, I'll take a cup of TA from you, if you please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony rose, with great stateliness, and walked to the farthest
      end of the room, where she established herself at her writing-table, and
      began to write notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence wiped his forehead deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I've had a fine run&#8212;Miss Nugent, I believe you never saw me
      run; but I can run, I promise you, when it's to serve a friend. And, my
      lord (turning to Lord Clonbrony), what do you think I run for this morning&#8212;to
      buy a bargain&#8212;and of what!&#8212;a bargain of a bad debt&#8212;a
      debt of yours, which I bargained for, and up just in time&#8212;and
      Mordicai's ready to hang himself this minute. For what do you think but
      that rascal was bringing upon you&#8212;but an execution?&#8212;he was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'An execution!' repeated everybody present, except Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And how has this been prevented, sir?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! let me alone for that,' said Sir Terence. 'I got a hint from my
      little friend, Paddy Brady, who would not be paid for it either, though
      he's as poor as a rat. Well! as soon as I got the hint, I dropped the
      thing I had in my hand, which was the DUBLIN EVENING, and ran for the bare
      life&#8212;for there wasn't a coach&#8212;in my slippers, as I was, to get
      into the prior creditor's shoes, who is the little solicitor that lives in
      Crutched Friars, which Mordicai never dreamt of, luckily; so he was very
      genteel, though he was taken on a sudden, and from his breakfast, which an
      Englishman don't like particularly&#8212;I popped him a douceur of a
      draught, at thirty-one days, on Garraghty, the agent; of which he must get
      notice; but I won't descant on the law before the ladies&#8212;he handed
      me over his debt and execution, and he made me prior creditor in a trice.
      Then I took coach in state, the first I met, and away with me to Long Acre&#8212;saw
      Mordicai. "Sir," says I, "I hear you're meditating an execution on a
      friend of mine." "Am I?" said the rascal; "who told you so?" "No matter,"
      said I; "but I just called in to let you know there's no use in life of
      your execution; for there's a prior creditor with his execution to be
      satisfied first." So he made a great many black faces, and said a great
      deal, which I never listened to, but came off here clean to tell you all
      the story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one word of which do I understand,' said Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, my dear, you are very ungrateful,' said Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre said nothing, for he wished to learn more of Sir Terence
      O'Fay's character, of the state of his father's affairs, and of the family
      methods of proceeding in matters of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Faith! Terry, I know I'm very thankful to you&#8212;but an execution's an
      ugly thing&#8212;and I hope there's no danger&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never fear!' said Sir Terence: 'Haven't I been at my wits' ends for
      myself or my friends ever since I come to man's estate&#8212;to years of
      discretion, I should say, for the deuce a foot of estate have I! But use
      has sharpened my wits pretty well for your service; so never be in dread,
      my good lord for look ye!' cried the reckless knight, sticking his arms
      akimbo 'look ye here! in Sir Terence O'Fay stands a host that desires no
      better than to encounter, single witted, all the duns in the united
      kingdoms, Mordicai the Jew inclusive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! that's the devil, that Mordicai,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'that's the
      only man an earth I dread.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, he is only a coachmaker, is not he!' said Lady Clonbrony: 'I can't
      think how you can talk, my lord, of dreading such a low man. Tell him, if
      he's troublesome, we won't bespeak any more carriages; and, I'm sure, I
      wish you would not be so silly, my lord, to employ him any more, when you
      know he disappointed me the last birthday about the landau, which I have
      not got yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, my dear,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'you don't know what you are
      talking of. Terry, I say, even a friendly execution is an ugly thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Phoo! phoo!&#8212;an ugly thing! So is a fit of the gout&#8212;but one's
      all the better for it after. 'Tis just a renewal of life, my lord, for
      which one must pay a bit of a fine, you know. Take patience, and leave me
      to manage all properly&#8212;you know I'm used to these things, Only you
      recollect, if you please, how I managed my friend Lord &#8212;; it's bad
      to be mentioning names&#8212;but Lord EVERYBODY-KNOWS-WHO&#8212;didn't I
      bring him through cleverly, when there was that rascally attempt to seize
      the family plate? I had notice, and what did I do, but broke open a
      partition between that lord's house and my lodgings, which I had taken
      next door; and so, when the sheriff's officers were searching below on the
      ground floor, I just shoved the plate easy through to my bedchamber at a
      moment's warning, and then bid the gentlemen walk in, for they couldn't
      set a foot in my paradise, the devils! So they stood looking at it through
      the wall, and cursing me and I holding both my sides with laughter at
      their fallen faces.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence and Lord Clonbrony laughed in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is a good story,' said Miss Nugent, smiling; 'but surely, Sir
      Terence, such things are never done in real life?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Done! ay, are they; and I could tell you a hundred better strokes, my
      dear Miss Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace!' cried Lady Clonbrony, 'do pray have the goodness to seal and send
      these notes; for really,' whispered she, as her niece came to the table,'I
      CAWNT STEE, I cawnt bear that man's VICE, his accent grows horrider and
      horrider!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship rose, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, then,' continued Sir Terence, following up Miss Nugent to the table,
      where she was sealing letters, 'I must tell you how I sarved that same man
      on another occasion, and got the victory too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No general officer could talk of his victories, or fight his battles o'er
      again, with more complacency than Sir Terence O'Fay recounted his CIVIL
      exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I'll tell Miss Nugent. There was a footman in the family, not an
      Irishman, but one of your powdered English scoundrels that ladies are so
      fond of having hanging to the backs of their carriages; one Fleming he
      was, that turned spy, and traitor, and informer, went privately and gave
      notice to the creditors where the plate was hid in the thickness of the
      chimney; but if he did, what happened! Why, I had my counter-spy, an
      honest little Irish boy, in the creditor's shop, that I had secured with a
      little douceur of usquebaugh; and he outwitted, as was natural, the
      English lying valet, and gave us notice just in the nick, and I got ready
      for their reception; and, Miss Nugent, I only wish you'd seen the
      excellent sport we had, letting them follow the scent they got; and when
      they were sure of their game, what did they find?&#8212;Ha! ha! ha!&#8212;dragged
      out, after a world of labour, a heavy box of&#8212;a load of brickbats;
      not an item of my friend's plate&#8212;that was all snug in the coal-hole,
      where them dunces never thought of looking for it. Ha! ha! ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But come, Terry,' cried Lord Clonbrony, 'I'll pull down your pride. How
      finely, another time, your job of the false ceiling answered in the hall.
      I've heard that story, and have been told how the sheriffs fellow thrust
      his bayonet up through your false plaster, and down came tumbling the
      family plate hey, Terry? That hit cost your friend, Lord
      everybody-knows-who, more than your head's worth, Terry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ask your pardon, my lord, it never cost him a farthing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When he paid L7000 for the plate, to redeem it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well! and did not I make up for that at the races of &#8212;? The
      creditors learned that my lord's horse, Naboclish, was to run at&#8212;races;
      and, as the sheriff's officer knew he dare not touch him on the
      race-ground, what does he do, but he comes down early in the morning on
      the mail-coach, and walks straight down to the livery stables. He had an
      exact description of the stables, and the stall, and the horse's
      body-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was there, seeing the horse taken care of; and, knowing the cut of the
      fellow's jib, what does I do, but whips the body-clothes off Naboclish,
      and claps them upon a garrone that the priest would not ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In comes the bailiff&#8212;"Good morrow to you, sir," says I, leading out
      of the stable my lord's horse, with an OULD saddle and bridle on.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Tim Neal," says I to the groom, who was rubbing down the garrone's
      heels, "mind your hits to-day, and WEE'L wet the plate to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Not so fast, neither," says the bailiff&#8212;"here's my writ for
      seizing the horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Och," says I, "you wouldn't be so cruel."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all my eye," says he, seizing the garrone, while I mounted
      Naboclish, and rode him off deliberately to &#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha! ha! ha!&#8212;That was neat, I grant you, Terry,' said Lord
      Clonbrony. 'But what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow
      have been, not to know Naboclish when he saw him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But stay, my lord&#8212;stay, Miss Nugent&#8212;I have more for you,'
      following her wherever she moved. 'I did not let him off so, even. At the
      cant, I bid and bid against them for the pretended Naboclish, till I, left
      him on their hands for 500 guineas. Ha! ha! ha!&#8212;was not that
      famous?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But,' said Miss Nugent, 'I cannot believe you are in earnest, Sir
      Terence. Surely this would be&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?&#8212;out with it, my dear Miss Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid of offending you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can't, my dear, I defy you&#8212;say the word that came to the
      tongue's end; it's always the best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was going to say, swindling,' said the young lady, colouring deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! you was going to say wrong, then! It's not called swindling amongst
      gentlemen who know the world&#8212;it's only jockeying&#8212;fine sport&#8212;and
      very honourable to help a friend at a dead lift. Anything to get a friend
      out of a present pressing difficulty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when the present difficulty is over, do your friends never think of
      the future?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The future! leave the future to posterity,' said Sir Terence; 'I'm
      counsel only for the present; and when the evil comes, it's time enough to
      think of it. I can't bring the guns of my wits to bear till the enemy's
      alongside of me, or within sight of me at the least. And besides, there
      never was a good commander yet, by sea or land, that would tell his little
      expedients beforehand, or before the very day of battle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It must be a sad thing,' said Miss Nugent, sighing deeply, 'to be reduced
      to live by little expedients&#8212;daily expedients.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre struck his forehead, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But if you are beating your brains about your own affairs, my Lord
      Colambre, my dear,' said Sir Terence, 'there's an easy way of settling
      your family affairs at once; and, since you don't like little daily
      expedients, Miss Nugent, there's one great expedient, and an expedient for
      life, that will settle it all to your satisfaction&#8212;and ours. I
      hinted it delicately to you before, but, between friends, delicacy is
      impertinent; so I tell you, in plain English, you've nothing to do but go
      and propose yourself, just as you stand, to the heiress Miss B&#8212;,
      that desires no better&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir!' cried Lord Colambre, stepping forward, red with sudden anger. Miss
      Nugent laid her hand upon his arm&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my lord!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir Terence O'Fay,' continued Lord Colambre, in a moderated tone, 'you
      are wrong to mention that young lady's name in such a manner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, then, I said only Miss B&#8212;, and there are a whole hive of BEES.
      But I'll engage she'd thank me for what I suggested, and think herself the
      queen bee if my expedient was adopted by you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir Terence,' said his lordship, smiling, 'if my father thinks proper
      that you should manage his affairs, and devise expedients for him, I have
      nothing to say on that point; but I must beg you will not trouble yourself
      to suggest expedients for me, and that you will have the goodness to leave
      me to settle my own affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence made a low bow, and was silent for five seconds; then turning
      to Lord Clonbrony, who looked much more abashed than he did&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the wise one, my good lord, I believe there are some men&#8212;noblemen,
      too&#8212;that don't know their friends from their enemies. It's my firm
      persuasion, now, that if I had served you as I served my friend I was
      talking of, your son there would, ten to one, think I had done him an
      injury by saving the family plate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I certainly should, sir. The family plate, sir, is not the first object
      in my mind,' replied Lord Colambre; 'family honour&#8212;Nay, Miss Nugent,
      I must speak,' continued his lordship, perceiving; by her countenance,
      that she was alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never fear, Miss Nugent dear,' said Sir Terence; 'I'm as cool as a
      cucumber. Faith! then, my Lord Colambre, I agree with you, that family
      honour's a mighty fine thing, only troublesome to one's self and one's
      friends, and expensive to keep up with all the other expenses and debts a
      gentleman has nowadays. So I, that am under no natural obligations to it
      by birth or otherwise, have just stood by through life, and asked myself,
      before I would volunteer being bound to it, what could this same family
      honour do for a man in this world? And, first and foremost, I never
      remember to see family honour stand a man in much stead in a court of law&#8212;never
      saw family honour stand against an execution, or a custodiam, or an
      injunction even. 'Tis a rare thing, this same family honour, and a very
      fine thing; but I never knew it yet, at a pinch, pay for a pair of boots
      even,' added Sir Terence, drawing up his own with much complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Sir Terence was called out of the room by one who wanted to
      speak to him on particular business.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear father,' cried Lord Colambre, 'do not follow him; stay for one
      moment, and hear your son&#8212;your true friend.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent went out of the room, that she might leave the father and son
      at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear your natural friend for one moment,' cried Lord Colambre. 'Let me
      beseech you, father, not to have recourse to any of these paltry
      expedients, but trust your son with the state of your affairs, and we
      shall find some honourable means&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, yes, very true; when you're of age, Colambre, we'll talk of it;
      but nothing can be done till then. We shall get on, we shall get through,
      very well, till then, with Terry's assistance. And I must beg you will not
      say a word more against Terry&#8212;I can't bear it&#8212;I can't hear it&#8212;I
      can't do without him. Pray don't detain me&#8212;I can say no more&#8212;except,'
      added he, returning to his usual concluding sentence, 'that there need, at
      all events, be none of this, if people would but live upon their own
      estates, and kill their own mutton.' He stole out of the room, glad to
      escape, however shabbily, from present explanation and present pain. There
      are persons without resource who in difficulties return always to the same
      point, and usually to the same words.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Lord Colambre was walking up and down the room, much vexed and
      disappointed at finding that he could make no impression on his father's
      mind, nor obtain his confidence as to his family affairs, Lady Clonbrony's
      woman, Mrs. Petito, knocked at the door, with a message from her lady, to
      beg, if Lord Colambre was BY HIMSELF; he would go to her dressing-room, as
      she wished to have a conference with him. He obeyed her summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down, my dear Colambre&#8212;' And she began precisely with her old
      sentence&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'With the fortune I brought your father, and with my lord's estate, I
      CAWNT understand the meaning of all these pecuniary difficulties; and all
      that strange creature Sir Terence says is algebra to me, who speak
      English. And I am particularly sorry he was let in this morning&#8212;but
      he's such a brute that he does not think anything of forcing one's door,
      and he tells my footman he does not mind NOT AT HOME a pinch of snuff. Now
      what can you do with a man who could say that sort of thing, you know&#8212;the
      world's at an end.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish my father had nothing to do with him, ma'am, as much as you can
      wish it,' said Lord Colambre; 'but I have said all that a son can with
      propriety say, and without effect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What particularly provokes me against him,' continued Lady Clonbrony, 'is
      what I have just heard from Grace, who was really hurt by it, too, for she
      is the warmest friend in the world: I allude to the creature's indelicate
      way of touching upon a tender PINT, and mentioning an amiable young
      heiress's name. My dear Colambre, I trust you have given me credit for my
      inviolable silence all this time upon the PINT nearest my heart. I am
      rejoiced to hear you was so warm when she was mentioned inadvertently by
      that brute, and I trust you now see the advantages of the projected union
      in as strong and agreeable a PINT of view as I do, my own Colambre; and I
      should leave things to themselves, and let you prolong the DEES of
      courtship as you please, only for what I now hear incidentally from my
      lord and the brute, about pecuniary embarrassments, and the necessity of
      something being done before next winter. And indeed I think now, in
      propriety, the proposal cannot be delayed much longer; for the world
      begins to talk of the thing as done; and even Mrs. Broadhurst, I know, had
      no doubt that, if this CONTRETEMPS about the poor Berryls had not
      occurred, your proposal would have been made before the end of last week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero was not a man to make a proposal because Mrs. Broadhurst expected
      it, or to marry because the world said he was going to be married. He
      steadily said that, from the first moment the subject had been mentioned,
      he had explained himself distinctly; that the young lady's friends could
      not, therefore, be under any doubt as to his intentions; that, if they had
      voluntarily deceived themselves, or exposed the lady in situations from
      which the world was led to make false conclusions, he was not answerable:
      he felt his conscience at ease&#8212;entirely so, as he was convinced that
      the young lady herself, for whose merit, talents, independence, and
      generosity of character he professed high respect, esteem, and admiration,
      had no doubts either of the extent or the nature of his regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Regard, respect, esteem, admiration!&#8212;Why, my dearest Colambre! this
      is saying all I want; satisfies me, and I am sure would satisfy Mrs
      Broadhurst and Miss Broadhurst too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt it will, ma'am; but not if I aspired to the honour of Miss
      Broadhurst's hand, or professed myself her lover.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, you are mistaken; Miss Broadhurst is too sensible a girl, a vast
      deal, to look for love, and a dying lover, and all that sort of stuff; I
      am persuaded&#8212;indeed I have it from good, from the best authority&#8212;that
      the young lady&#8212;you know one must be delicate in these cases, where a
      young lady of such fortune, and no despicable family too is concerned;
      therefore I cannot speak quite plainly&#8212;but I say I have it from the
      best authority, that you would be preferred to any other suitor, and, in
      short, that&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you,' cried Lord Colambre,
      colouring a good deal; 'but you must excuse me if I say, that the only
      authority on which I could believe this is one from which I am morally
      certain I shall never hear it from Miss Broadhurst herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord, child! if you would only ask her the question, she would tell you
      it is truth, I daresay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But as I have no curiosity on the subject, ma'am&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord bless me! I thought everybody had curiosity. But still, without
      curiosity, I am sure it would gratify you when you did hear it; and can't
      you just put the simple question?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Impossible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Impossible!&#8212;now that is so very provoking when the thing is all but
      done. Well, take your own time; all I will ask of you then is, to let
      things go on as they are going&#8212;smoothly and pleasantly; and I'll not
      press you farther on the subject at present, Let things go on smoothly,
      that's all I ask, and say nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could oblige you, mother; but I cannot do this. Since you tell
      me that the world and Miss Broadhurst's friends have already misunderstood
      my intentions, it becomes necessary, in justice to the young lady and to
      myself, that I should make all further doubt impossible. I shall,
      therefore, put an end to it at once, by leaving town to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony, breathless for a moment with surprise, exclaimed, 'Bless
      me! leave town to-morrow! Just at the beginning of the season! Impossible!&#8212;I
      never saw such a precipitate, rash young man. But stay only a few weeks,
      Colambre; the physicians advise Buxton for my rheumatism, and you shall
      take us to Buxton early in the season&#8212;you cannot refuse me that.
      Why, if Miss Broadhurst was a dragon, you could not be in a greater hurry
      to run away from her. What are you afraid of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of doing what is wrong&#8212;the only thing, I trust, of which I shall
      ever be afraid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony tried persuasion and argument&#8212;such argument as she
      could use&#8212;but all in vain&#8212;Lord Colambre was firm in his
      resolution; at last, she came to tears; and her son, in much agitation,
      said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot bear this, mother! I would do anything you ask, that I could do
      with honour; but this is impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why impossible? I will take all blame upon myself; and you are sure that
      Miss Broadhurst does not misunderstand you, and you esteem her, and admire
      her, and all that; and all I ask is, that you'll go on as you are, and see
      more of her; and how do you know but you may fall in love with her, as you
      call it, to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because, madam, since you press me so far, my affections are engaged to
      another person. Do not look so dreadfully shocked, my dear mother&#8212;I
      have told you truly, that I think myself too young, much too young, yet to
      marry. In the circumstances in which I know my family are, it is probable
      that I shall not for some years be able to marry as I wish. You may depend
      upon it that I shall not take any step, I shall not even declare my
      attachment to the object of my affection, without your knowledge; and, far
      from being inclined to follow headlong my own passions&#8212;strong as
      they are&#8212;be assured that the honour of my family, your happiness, my
      mother, my father's, are my first objects: I shall never think of my own
      till these are secured.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the conclusion of this speech, Lady Clonbrony heard only the sound of
      the words; from the moment her son had pronounced that his affections were
      engaged, she had been running over in her head every probable and
      improbable person she could think of; at last, suddenly starting up, she
      opened one of the folding-doors into the next apartment, and called&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace!&#8212;Grace Nugent!&#8212;put down your pencil, Grace, this
      minute, and come here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent obeyed with her usual alacrity; and the moment she entered the
      room, Lady Clonbrony, fixing her eyes full upon her, said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's your cousin Colambre tells me his affections are engaged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, to Miss Broadhurst, no doubt,' said Miss Nugent, smiling, with a
      simplicity and openness of countenance which assured Lady Clonbrony that
      all was safe in that quarter: a suspicion which had darted into her mind
      was dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt. Ay, do you hear that NO DOUBT, Colambre?&#8212;Grace, you see,
      has no doubt; nobody has any doubt but yourself, Colambre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And are your affections engaged, and not to Miss Broadhurst?' said Miss
      Nugent, approaching Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There now! you see how you surprise and disappoint everybody, Colambre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry that Miss Nugent should be disappointed,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But because I am disappointed, pray do not call me Miss Nugent, or turn
      away from me, as if you were displeased.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It must, then, be some Cambridgeshire lady,' said Lady Clonbrony. 'I am
      sure I am very sorry he ever went to Cambridge,&#8212;Oxford I advised:
      one of the Miss Berryls, I presume, who have nothing. I'll have nothing
      more to do with those Berryls&#8212;there was the reason of the son's vast
      intimacy. Grace, you may give up all thoughts of Sir Arthur.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no thoughts to give up, ma'am,' said Miss Nugent, smiling. 'Miss
      Broadhurst,' continued she, going on eagerly with what she was saying to
      Lord Colambre&#8212;'Miss Broadhurst is my friend, a friend I love and
      admire; but you will allow that I strictly kept my promise, never to
      praise her to you, till you should begin to praise her to me. Now
      recollect, last night, you did praise her to me, so justly, that I thought
      you liked her, I confess; so that it is natural I should feel a little
      disappointed. Now you know the whole of my mind; I have no intention to
      encroach on your confidence; therefore, there is no occasion to look so
      embarrassed. I give you my word, I will never speak to you again upon the
      subject,' said she, holding out her hand to him, 'provided you will never
      again call me Miss Nugent. Am I not your own cousin Grace&#8212;Do not be
      displeased with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are my own dear cousin Grace; and nothing can be farther from my mind
      than any thought of being displeased with her; especially just at this
      moment, when I am going away, probably for a considerable time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Away!&#8212;when?&#8212;where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow morning, for Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ireland! of all places,' cried Lady Clonbrony. 'What upon earth puts it
      into your head to go to Ireland? You do very well to go out of the way of
      falling in love ridiculously, since that is the reason of your going; but
      what put Ireland into your head, child?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not presume to ask my mother what put Ireland out of her head,'
      said Lord Colambre, smiling; 'but she will recollect that it is my native
      country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was your father's fault, not mine,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'for I
      wished to have been confined in England; but he would have it to say that
      his son and heir was born at Clonbrony Castle&#8212;and there was a great
      argument between him and my uncle, and something about the Prince of Wales
      and Caernarvon Castle was thrown in, and that turned the scale, much
      against my will; for it was my wish that my son should be an Englishman
      born&#8212;like myself. But, after all, I don't see that having the
      misfortune to be born in a country should tie one to it in any sort of
      way; and I should have hoped your English EDICATION, Colambre, would have
      given you too liberal IDEARS for that&#8212;so I REELLY don't see why you
      should go to Ireland merely because it's your native country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not merely because it is my native country; but I wish to go thither&#8212;I
      desire to become acquainted with it&#8212;because it is the country in
      which my father's property lies, and from which we draw our subsistence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Subsistence! Lord bless me, what a word! fitter for a pauper than a
      nobleman&#8212;subsistence! Then, if you are going to look after your
      father's property, I hope you will make the agents do their duty, and send
      us remittances. And pray how long do you mean to stay?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Till I am of age, madam, if you have no objection. I will spend the
      ensuing months in travelling in Ireland; and I will return here by the
      time I am of age, unless you and my father should, before that time, be in
      Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not the least chance of that, if I can prevent it, I promise you,' said
      Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre and Miss Nugent sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I am sure I shall take it very unkindly of you, Colambre, if you go
      and turn out a partisan for Ireland, after all, like Grace Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A partisan! no;&#8212;I hope not a partisan, but a friend,' said Miss
      Nugent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, child!&#8212;I hate to hear people, women especially, and young
      ladies particularly, talk of being friends to this country or that
      country. What can they know about countries? Better think of being friends
      to themselves, and friends to their friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was wrong,' said Miss Nugent, 'to call myself a friend to Ireland; I
      meant to say, that Ireland had been a friend to me; that I found Irish
      friends, when I had no other; an Irish home, when I had no other; that my
      earliest and happiest years, under your kind care, had been spent there;
      and that I can never forget THAT my dear aunt&#8212;I hope you do not wish
      that I should.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heaven forbid, my sweet Grace!' said Lady Clonbrony, touched by her voice
      and manner&#8212;'Heaven forbid! I don't wish you to do or be anything but
      what you are; for I am convinced there's nothing I could ask you would not
      do for me; and, I can tell you, there's few things you could ask, love, I
      would not do for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A wish was instantly expressed in the eyes of her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony, though not usually quick at interpreting the wishes of
      others, understood and answered, before she ventured to make her request
      in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ask anything but THAT, Grace. Return to Clonbrony, while I am able to
      live in London? That I never can or will do for you or anybody!' looking
      at her son in all the pride of obstinacy; 'so there is an end of the
      matter. Go you where you please, Colambre; and I shall stay where I
      please:&#8212;I suppose, as your mother, I have a right to say this much?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son, with the utmost respect, assured her that he had no design to
      infringe upon her undoubted liberty of judging for herself; that he had
      never interfered, except so far as to tell her circumstances of her
      affairs, with which she seemed to be totally unacquainted, and of which it
      might be dangerous to her to continue in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk to me about affairs,' cried she, drawing her hand away from
      her son. 'Talk to my lord, or my lord's agents, since you are going to
      Ireland, about business&#8212;I know nothing about business; but this I
      know, I shall stay in England, and be in London, every season, as long as
      I can afford it; and when I cannot afford to live here, I hope I shall not
      live anywhere. That's my notion of life; and that's my determination, once
      for all; for, if none of the rest of the Clonbrony family have any, I
      thank Heaven I have some spirit.' Saying this, with her most stately
      manner she walked out of the room. Lord Colambre instantly followed her;
      for, after the resolution and the promise he had made, he did not dare to
      trust himself at this moment with Miss Nugent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be a concert this night at Lady Clonbrony's, at which Mrs.
      and Miss Broadhurst were, of course, expected. That they might not be
      quite unprepared for the event of her son's going to Ireland, Lady
      Clonbrony wrote a note to Mrs. Broadhurst, begging her to come half an
      hour earlier than the time mentioned in the cards, 'that she might talk
      over something PARTICULAR that had just occurred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed at this cabinet council, as it seems to have had no immediate
      influence on affairs, we need not record. Suffice it to observe, that a
      great deal was said, and nothing done. Miss Broadhurst, however, was not a
      young lady who could be easily deceived, even where her passions were
      concerned. The moment her mother told her of Lord Colambre's intended
      departure, she saw the whole truth. She had a strong mind&#8212;was
      capable of drawing aside, at once, the curtain of self-delusion, and
      looking steadily at the skeleton of truth&#8212;she had a generous,
      perhaps because a strong mind; for, surrounded, as she had been from her
      childhood, by every means of self-indulgence which wealth and flattery
      could bestow, she had discovered early, what few persons in her situation
      discover till late in life, that selfish gratifications may render us
      incapable of other happiness, but can never, of themselves, make us happy.
      Despising flatterers, she had determined to make herself friends to make
      them in the only possible way&#8212;by deserving them. Her father made his
      immense fortune by the power and habit of constant, bold, and just
      calculation. The power and habit which she had learned from him she
      applied on a far larger scale; with him, it was confined to speculations
      for the acquisition of money; with her, it extended to the attainment of
      happiness. He was calculating and mercenary: she was estimative and
      generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent was dressing for the concert, or, rather, was sitting
      half-dressed before her glass, reflecting, when Miss Broadhurst came into
      her room. Miss Nugent immediately sent her maid out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace,' said Miss Broadhurst, looking at Grace with an air of open,
      deliberate composure, 'you and I are thinking of the same thing&#8212;of
      the same person.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of Lord Colambre,' said Miss Nugent, ingenuously and sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I can put your mind at ease, at once, my dear friend, by assuring
      you that I shall think of him no more. That I have thought of him, I do
      not deny&#8212;I have thought, that if, notwithstanding the difference in
      our ages, and other differences, he had preferred me, I should have
      preferred him to any person who has ever yet addressed me. On our first
      acquaintance, I clearly saw that he was not disposed to pay court to my
      fortune; and I had also then coolness of judgment sufficient to perceive
      that it was not probable he should fall in love with my person. But I was
      too proud in my humility, too strong in my honesty, too brave, too
      ignorant; in short, I knew nothing of the matter. We are all of us, more
      or less, subject to the delusions of vanity, or hope, or love&#8212;I&#8212;even
      I!&#8212;who thought myself so clear-sighted, did not know how, with one
      flutter of his wings, Cupid can set the whole atmosphere in motion; change
      the proportions, size, colour, value, of every object; lead us into a
      mirage, and leave us in a dismal desert.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dearest friend!' said Miss Nugent, in a tone of true sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But none but a coward, or a fool would sit down in the desert and weep,
      instead of trying to make his way back before the storm rises, obliterates
      the track, and overwhelms everything. Poetry apart, my dear Grace, you may
      be assured that I shall think no more of Lord Colambre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you are right. But I am sorry, very sorry, it must be so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, spare me your sorrow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My sorrow is for Lord Colambre,' said Miss Nugent. 'Where will he find
      such a wife?&#8212;Not in Miss Berryl, I am sure&#8212;pretty as she is; a
      mere fine lady! Is it possible that Lord Colambre! Lord Colambre! should
      prefer such a girl&#8212;Lord Colambre!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Broadhurst looked at her friend as she spoke, and saw truth in her
      eyes; saw that she had no suspicion that she was herself the person
      beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell me, Grace, are you sorry that Lord Colambre is going away?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I am glad. I was sorry when I first heard it; but now I am glad, very
      glad; it may save him from a marriage unworthy of him, restore him to
      himself, and reserve him for&#8212;the only woman I ever saw who is suited
      to him, who is equal to him, who would value and love him, as he deserves
      to be valued and loved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop, my dear; if you mean me, I am not, and I never can be, that woman.
      Therefore, as you are my friend, and wish my happiness, as I sincerely
      believe you do, never, I conjure you, present such an idea before my mind
      again&#8212;it is out of my mind, I hope, for ever. It is important to me
      that you should know and believe this. At least I will preserve my
      friends. Now let this subject never be mentioned or alluded to again
      between us, my dear. We have subjects enough of conversation; we need not
      have recourse to pernicious sentimental gossipings. There is a great
      difference between wanting a CONFIDANTE, and treating a friend with
      confidence. My confidence you possess; all that ought, all that is to be
      known of my mind, you know, and&#8212;Now I will leave you in peace to
      dress for the concert.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, don't go! you don't interrupt me. I shall be dressed in a few
      minutes; stay with me, and you may be assured, that neither now, nor at
      any other time, shall I ever speak to you on the subject you desire me to
      avoid. I entirely agree with you about CONFIDANTES and sentimental
      gossipings. I love you for not loving them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A thundering knock at the door announced the arrival of company.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Think no more of love, but as much as you please of friendship&#8212;dress
      yourself as fast as you can,' said Miss Broadhurst. 'Dress, dress is the
      order of the day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Order of the day and order of the night, and all for people I don't care
      for in the least,' said Grace. 'So life passes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me, Miss Nugent,' cried Petito, Lady Clonbrony's woman, coming in
      with a face of alarm, 'not dressed yet! My lady is gone down, and Mrs.
      Broadhurst and my Lady Pococke's come, and the Honourable Mrs. Trembleham;
      and signor, the Italian singing gentleman, has been walking up and down
      the apartments there by himself, disconsolate, this half-hour, and I
      wondering all the time nobody rang for me&#8212;but my lady dressed, Lord
      knows how! without anybody. Oh, merciful! Miss Nugent, if you could stand
      still for one single particle of a second. So then I thought of stepping
      in to Miss Nugent; for the young ladies are talking so fast, says I to
      myself, at the door, they will never know how time goes, unless I give 'em
      a hint. But now my lady is below, there's no need, to be sure, to be
      nervous, so we may take the thing quietly, without being in a flustrum.
      Dear ladies, is not this now a very sudden motion of our young lord's for
      Ireland?&#8212;Lud a mercy! Miss Nugent, I'm sure your motions is sudden
      enough; and your dress behind is all, I'm sure, I can't tell how.'&#8212;'Oh,
      never mind,' said the young lady, escaping from her; 'it will do very
      well, thank you, Petito.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will do very well, never mind,' repeated Petito muttering to herself,
      as she looked after the ladies, whilst they ran downstairs. 'I can't abide
      to dress any young lady who says never mind, and it will do very well.
      That, and her never talking to one confiDANtially, or trusting one with
      the least bit of her secrets, is the thing I can't put up with from Miss
      Nugent; and Miss Broadhurst holding the pins to me, as much as to say, Do
      your business, Petito, and don't talk.&#8212;Now, that's so impertinent,
      as if one wasn't the same flesh and blood, and had not as good a right to
      talk of everything, and hear of everything, as themselves. And Mrs.
      Broadhurst, too, cabinet-councilling with my lady, and pursing up her city
      mouth when I come in, and turning off the discourse to snuff, forsooth; as
      if I was an ignoramus, to think they closeted themselves to talk of snuff.
      Now, I think a lady of quality's woman has as good a right to be trusted
      with her lady's secrets as with her jewels; and if my Lady Clonbrony was a
      real lady of quality, she'd know that, and consider the one as much my
      paraphernalia as the other. So I shall tell my lady to-night, as I always
      do when she vexes me, that I never lived in an Irish family before, and
      don't know the ways of it&#8212;then she'll tell me she was born in
      Hoxfordshire&#8212;then I shall say, with my saucy look, "Oh, was you, my
      lady?&#8212;I always forget that you was an Englishwoman:" then maybe
      she'll say, "Forget!&#8212;you forget yourself strangely, Petito." Then I
      shall say, with a great deal of dignity, "If your ladyship thinks so, my
      lady, I'd better go." And I'd desire no better than that she would take me
      at my word; for my Lady Dashfort's is a much better place, I'm told, and
      she's dying to have me, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And having formed this resolution, Petito concluded her apparently
      interminable soliloquy, and went with my lord's gentleman into the
      antechamber, to hear the concert, and give her judgment on everything; as
      she peeped in through the vista of heads into the Apollo saloon&#8212;for
      to-night the Alhambra was transformed into the Apollo saloon&#8212;she saw
      that whilst the company, rank behind rank, in close semicircles, had
      crowded round the performers to hear a favourite singer, Miss Broadhurst
      and Lord Colambre were standing in the outer semicircle, talking to one
      another earnestly. Now would Petito have given up her reversionary chance
      of the three nearly new gowns she expected from Lady Clonbrony, in case
      she stayed; or, in case she went, the reversionary chance of any dress of
      Lady Dashfort's except her scarlet velvet, merely to hear what Miss
      Broadhurst and Lord Colambre were saying. Alas! she could only see their
      lips move; and of what they were talking, whether of music or love, and
      whether the match was to be on or off; she could only conjecture. But the
      diplomatic style having now descended to waiting-maids, Mrs. Petito talked
      to her friends in the antechamber with as mysterious and consequential an
      air and tone, as a CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, or as the lady of a CHARGE
      D'AFFAIRES, could have assumed. She spoke of HER PRIVATE BELIEF; of THE
      IMPRESSION LEFT UPON HER MIND; and her CONFIDANTIAL reasons for thinking
      as she did; of her 'having had it from the FOUNTAIN'S head;' and of 'her
      fear of any COMMITTAL of her authorities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all these authorities, Lord Colambre left London next day,
      and pursued his way to Ireland, determined that he would see and judge of
      that country for himself, and decide whether his mother's dislike to
      residing there was founded on caprice or reasonable causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, it was reported in London that his lordship was gone to
      Ireland to make out the title to some estate, which would be necessary for
      his marriage settlement with the great heiress, Miss Broadhurst. Whether
      Mrs. Petito or Sir Terence O'Fay had the greater share in raising and
      spreading this report, it would be difficult to determine; but it is
      certain, however or by whomsoever raised, it was most useful to Lord
      Clonbrony, by keeping his creditors quiet.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tide did not permit the packet to reach the Pigeon-house, and the
      impatient Lord Colambre stepped into a boat, and was rowed across the bay
      of Dublin. It was a fine summer morning. The sun shone bright on the
      Wicklow mountains. He admired, he exulted in the beauty of the prospect;
      and all the early associations of his childhood, and the patriotic hopes
      of his riper years, swelled his heart as he approached the shores of his
      native land. But scarcely had he touched his mother earth, when the whole
      course of his ideas was changed; and if his heart swelled, it swelled no
      more with pleasurable sensations, for instantly he found himself
      surrounded and attacked by a swarm of beggars and harpies, with strange
      figures and stranger tones: some craving his charity, some snatching away
      his luggage, and at the same time bidding him 'never trouble himself,' and
      'never fear.' A scramble in the boat and on shore for bags and parcels
      began, and an amphibious fight betwixt men, who had one foot on sea and
      one on land, was seen; and long and loud the battle of trunks and
      portmanteaus raged! The vanquished departed, clinching their empty hands
      at their opponents, and swearing inextinguishable hatred; while the
      smiling victors stood at ease, each grasping his booty&#8212;bag, basket,
      parcel, or portmanteau: 'And, your honour, where WILL these go?&#8212;Where
      WILL we carry 'em all to, for your honour?' was now the question. Without
      waiting for an answer, most of the goods were carried at the discretion of
      the porters to the custom-house, where, to his lordship's astonishment,
      after this scene of confusion, he found that he had lost nothing but his
      patience; all his goods were safe, and a few TINPENNIES made his officious
      porters happy men and boys; blessings were showered upon his honour, and
      he was left in peace at an excellent hotel in &#8212;Street, Dublin. He
      rested, refreshed himself, recovered his good-humour, and walked into the
      coffee-house, where he found several officers&#8212;English, Irish, and
      Scotch. One English officer, a very gentleman-like, sensible-looking man,
      of middle age, was sitting reading a little pamphlet, when Lord Colambre
      entered; he looked up from time to time, and in a few minutes rose and
      joined the conversation; it turned upon the beauties and defects of the
      city of Dublin. Sir James Brooke, for that was the name of the gentleman,
      showed one of his brother officers the book which he had been reading,
      observing that, in his opinion, it contained one of the best views of
      Dublin which he had ever seen, evidently drawn by the hand of a master,
      though in a slight, playful, and ironical style: it was 'AN INTERCEPTED
      LETTER FROM CHINA.' The conversation extended from Dublin to various parts
      of Ireland, with all which Sir James Brooke showed that he was well
      acquainted. Observing that this conversation was particularly interesting
      to Lord Colambre, and quickly perceiving that he was speaking to one not
      ignorant of books, Sir James spoke of different representations and
      misrepresentations of Ireland. In answer to Lord Colambre's inquiries, he
      named the works which had afforded him most satisfaction; and with
      discriminative, not superficial celerity, touched on all ancient and
      modern authors, from Spenser and Davies to Young and Beaufort. Lord
      Colambre became anxious to cultivate the acquaintance of a gentleman who
      appeared so able and willing to afford him information. Sir James Brooke,
      on his part, was flattered by this eagerness of attention, and pleased by
      our hero's manners and conversation; so that, to their mutual
      satisfaction, they spent much of their time together whilst they were at
      this hotel; and, meeting frequently in society in Dublin, their
      acquaintance every day increased and grew into intimacy&#8212;an intimacy
      which was highly advantageous to Lord Colambre's views of obtaining a just
      idea of the state of manners in Ireland. Sir James Brooke had at different
      periods been quartered in various parts of the country&#8212;had resided
      long enough in each to become familiar with the people, and had varied his
      residence sufficiently to form comparisons between different counties,
      their habits, and characteristics. Hence he had it in his power to direct
      the attention of our young observer at once to the points most worthy of
      his examination, and to save him from the common error of travellers&#8212;the
      deducing general conclusions from a few particular cases, or arguing from
      exceptions as if they were rules. Lord Colambre, from his family
      connexions, had of course immediate introduction into the best society in
      Dublin, or rather into all the good society of Dublin. In Dublin there is
      positively good company, and positively bad; but not, as in London, many
      degrees of comparison: not innumerable luminaries of the polite world,
      moving in different orbits of fashion, but all the bright planets of note
      and name move and revolve in the same narrow limits. Lord Colambre did not
      find that either his father's or his mother's representations of society
      in Dublin resembled the reality, which he now beheld. Lady Clonbrony had,
      in terms of detestation, described Dublin such as it appeared to her soon
      after the Union; Lord Clonbrony had painted it with convivial enthusiasm,
      such as he saw it long and long before the Union, when FIRST he drank
      claret at the fashionable clubs. This picture, unchanged in his memory,
      and unchangeable by his imagination, had remained, and ever would remain,
      the same. The hospitality of which the father boasted, the son found in
      all its warmth, but meliorated and refined; less convivial, more social;
      the fashion of hospitality had improved. To make the stranger eat or drink
      to excess, to set before him old wine and old plate, was no longer the sum
      of good breeding. The guest now escaped the pomp of grand entertainments;
      was allowed to enjoy ease and conversation, and to taste some of that
      feast of reason and that flow of soul so often talked of, and so seldom
      enjoyed. Lord Colambre found a spirit of improvement, a desire for
      knowledge, and a taste for science and literature, in most companies,
      particularly among gentlemen belonging to the Irish bar; nor did he in
      Dublin society see any of that confusion of ranks or predominance of
      vulgarity of which his mother had complained. Lady Clonbrony had assured
      him that, the last time she had been at the drawing-room at the Castle, a
      lady, whom she afterwards found to be a grocer's wife, had turned angrily
      when her ladyship had accidentally trodden on her train, and had exclaimed
      with a strong brogue, 'I'll thank you, ma'am, for the rest of my tail.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Brooke, to whom Lord Colambre, without GIVING UP HIS AUTHORITY,
      mentioned the fact, declared that he had no doubt the thing had happened
      precisely as it was stated; but that this was one of the extraordinary
      cases which ought not to pass into a general rule&#8212;that it was a
      slight instance of that influence of temporary causes, from which no
      conclusions, as to national manners, should be drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I happened,' continued Sir James, 'to be quartered in Dublin soon after
      the Union took place; and I remember the great but transient change that
      appeared. From the removal of both Houses of Parliament, most of the
      nobility, and many of the principal families among the Irish commoners,
      either hurried in high hopes to London, or retired disgusted and in
      despair to their houses in the country. Immediately, in Dublin, commerce
      rose into the vacated seats of rank; wealth rose into the place of birth.
      New faces and new equipages appeared; people, who had never been heard of
      before, started into notice, pushed themselves forward, not scrupling to
      elbow their way even at the Castle; and they were presented to my
      lord-lieutenant and to my lady-lieutenant; for their excellencies, for the
      time being, might have played their vice-regal parts to empty benches, had
      they not admitted such persons for the moment to fill their court. Those
      of former times, of hereditary pretensions and high-bred minds and
      manners, were scandalised at all this; and they complained, with justice,
      that the whole TONE of society was altered; that the decorum, elegance,
      polish, and charm of society was gone; and I among the rest (said Sir
      James) felt and deplored their change. But, now it is all over, we may
      acknowledge that, perhaps, even those things which we felt most
      disagreeable at the time were productive of eventual benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Formerly, a few families had set the fashion. From time immemorial
      everything had, in Dublin, been submitted to their hereditary authority;
      and conversation, though it had been rendered polite by their example,
      was, at the same time, limited within narrow bounds. Young people,
      educated upon a more enlarged plan, in time grew up; and, no authority or
      fashion forbidding it, necessarily rose to their just place, and enjoyed
      their due influence in society. The want of manners, joined to the want of
      knowledge in the new set, created universal disgust: they were compelled,
      some by ridicule, some by bankruptcies, to fall back into their former
      places, from which they could never more emerge. In the meantime, some of
      the Irish nobility and gentry who had been living at an unusual expense in
      London&#8212;an expense beyond their incomes&#8212;were glad to return
      home to refit; and they brought with them a new stock of ideas, and some
      taste for science and literature, which, within these latter years, have
      become fashionable, indeed indispensable, in London. That part of the
      Irish aristocracy, who, immediately upon the first incursions of the
      vulgarians, had fled in despair to their fastnesses in the country,
      hearing of the improvements which had gradually taken place in society,
      and assured of the final expulsion of the barbarians, ventured from their
      retreats, and returned to their posts in town. So that now,' concluded Sir
      James, 'you find a society in Dublin composed of a most agreeable and
      salutary mixture of birth and education, gentility and knowledge, manner
      and matter; and you see pervading the whole new life and energy, new
      talent, new ambition, a desire and a determination to improve and be
      improved&#8212;a perception that higher distinction can now be obtained in
      almost all company, by genius and merit, than by airs and dress.... So
      much for the higher order. Now, among the class of tradesmen and
      shopkeepers, you may amuse yourself, my lord, with marking the difference
      between them and persons of the same rank in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre had several commissions to execute for his English friends,
      and he made it his amusement in every shop to observe the manners and
      habits of the people. He remarked that there are in Dublin two classes of
      tradespeople: one, who go into business with intent to make it their
      occupation for life, and as a slow but sure means of providing for
      themselves and their families; another class, who take up trade merely as
      a temporary resource, to which they condescend for a few years, trusting
      that they shall, in that time, make a fortune, retire, and commence or
      recommence gentlemen. The Irish regular men of business are like all other
      men of business&#8212;punctual, frugal, careful, and so forth; with the
      addition of more intelligence, invention, and enterprise than are usually
      found in Englishmen of the same rank. But the Dublin tradesmen PRO TEMPORE
      are a class by themselves; they begin without capital, buy stock upon
      credit in hopes of making large profits, and, in the same hopes, sell upon
      credit. Now, if the credit they can obtain is longer than that which they
      are forced to give, they go on and prosper; if not, they break, turn
      bankrupts, and sometimes, as bankrupts, thrive. By such men, of course,
      every SHORT CUT to fortune is followed; whilst every habit, which requires
      time to prove its advantage, is disregarded; nor with such views can a
      character for PUNCTUALITY have its just value. In the head of a man who
      intends to be a tradesman to-day, and a gentleman to-morrow, the ideas of
      the honesty and the duties of a tradesman, and of the honour and the
      accomplishments of a gentleman, are oddly jumbled together, and the
      characteristics of both are lost in the compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will OBLIGE you, but he will not obey you; he will do you a favour, but
      he will not do you JUSTICE; he will do ANYTHING TO SERVE YOU, but the
      particular thing you order he neglects; he asks your pardon, for he would
      not, for all the goods in his warehouse, DISOBLIGE you; not for the sake
      of your custom, but he has a particular regard for your family. Economy,
      in the eyes of such a tradesman, is, if not a mean vice, at least a shabby
      virtue, which he is too polite to suspect his customers of, and
      particularly proud to prove himself superior to. Many London tradesmen,
      after making their thousands and their tens of thousands, feel pride in
      still continuing to live like plain men of business; but from the moment a
      Dublin tradesman of this style has made a few hundreds, he sets up his
      gig, and then his head is in his carriage, and not in his business; and
      when he has made a few thousands, he buys or builds a country-house&#8212;and
      then, and thenceforward, his head, heart, and soul are in his
      country-house, and only his body in the shop with his customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he is making money, his wife, or rather his lady, is spending twice
      as much out of town as he makes in it. At the word country-house, let no
      one figure to himself a snug little box, like that in which a WARM London
      citizen, after long years of toil, indulges himself, one day out of seven,
      in repose&#8212;enjoying from his gazabo the smell of the dust, and the
      view of passing coaches on the London road. No: these Hibernian villas are
      on a much more magnificent scale; some of them formerly belonged to Irish
      members of Parliament, who are at a distance from their country-seats.
      After the Union these were bought by citizens and tradesmen, who spoiled,
      by the mixture of their own fancies, what had originally been designed by
      men of good taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after Lord Colambre's arrival in Dublin, he had an opportunity
      of seeing one of these villas, which belonged to Mrs. Raffarty, a grocer's
      lady, and sister to one of Lord Clonbrony's agents, Mr. Nicholas
      Garraghty. Lord Colambre was surprised to find that his father's agent
      resided in Dublin: he had been used to see agents, or stewards, as they
      are called in England, live in the country, and usually on the estate of
      which they have the management. Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, however, had a
      handsome house in a fashionable part of Dublin. Lord Colambre called
      several times to see him, but he was out of town, receiving rents for some
      other gentlemen, as he was agent for more than one property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though our hero had not the honour of seeing Mr. Garraghty, he had the
      pleasure of finding Mrs. Raffarty one day at her brother's house. Just as
      his lordship came to the door, she was going, on her jaunting-car, to her
      villa, called Tusculum, situate near Bray. She spoke much of the beauties
      of the vicinity of Dublin; found his lordship was going with Sir James
      Brooke and a party of gentlemen to see the county of Wicklow; and his
      lordship and party were entreated to do her the honour of taking in his
      way a little collation at Tusculum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero was glad to have an opportunity of seeing more of a species of
      fine lady with which he was unacquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was verbally made, and verbally accepted; but the lady
      afterwards thought it necessary to send a written invitation in due form,
      and the note she sent directed to the MOST RIGHT HONOURABLE the Lord
      Viscount Colambre. On opening it he perceived that it could not have been
      intended for him. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR JULIANA O'LEARY, I have got a promise from Colambre, that he will
      be with us at Tusculum on Friday the 20th, in his way from the county of
      Wicklow, for the collation I mentioned; and expect a large party of
      officers; so pray come early, with your house, or as many as the
      jaunting-car can bring. And pray, my dear, be ELEGANT. You need not let it
      transpire to Mrs. O'G&#8212;; but make my apologies to Miss O'G&#8212;, if
      she says anything, and tell her I'm quite concerned I can't ask her for
      that day; because, tell her, I'm so crowded, and am to have none that day
      but REAL QUALITY.&#8212;Yours ever and ever, ANASTASIA RAFFARTY. P.S.&#8212;And
      I hope to make the gentlemen stop the night with me; so will not have
      beds. Excuse haste, and compliments, etc. TUSCULUM, Sunday 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a charming tour in the county of Wicklow, where the beauty of the
      natural scenery, and the taste with which those natural beauties had been
      cultivated, far surpassed the sanguine expectations Lord Colambre had
      formed, his lordship and his companions arrived at Tusculum, where he
      found Mrs. Raffarty, and Miss Juliana O'Leary, very elegant, with a large
      party of the ladies and gentlemen of Bray, assembled in a drawing-room,
      fine with bad pictures and gaudy gilding; the windows were all shut, and
      the company were playing cards with all their might. This was the fashion
      of the neighbourhood. In compliment to Lord Colambre and the officers, the
      ladies left the card-tables; and Mrs. Raffarty, observing that his
      lordship seemed PARTIAL to walking, took him out, as she said, 'to do the
      honours of nature and art.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship was much amused by the mixture, which was now exhibited to
      him, of taste and incongruity, ingenuity and absurdity, genius and
      blunder; by the contrast between the finery and vulgarity, the affectation
      and ignorance of the lady of the villa. We should be obliged to STOP too
      long at Tusculum were we to attempt to detail all the odd circumstances of
      this visit; but we may record an example or two which may give a
      sufficient idea of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, before they left the drawing-room, Miss Juliana
      O'Leary pointed out to his lordship's attention a picture over the
      drawing-room chimney-piece. 'Is not it a fine piece, my lord?' said she,
      naming the price Mrs. Raffarty had lately paid for it at an auction.&#8212;'It
      has a right to be a fine piece, indeed; for it cost a fine price!'
      Nevertheless this FINE piece was a vile daub; and our hero could only
      avoid the sin of flattery, or the danger of offending the lady, by
      protesting that he had no judgment in pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, I don't pretend to be a connoisseur or conoscenti myself; but I'm
      told the style is undeniably modern. And was not I lucky, Juliana, not to
      let that MEDONA be knocked down to me? I was just going to bid, when I
      heard such smart bidding; but fortunately the auctioneer let out that it
      was done by a very old master&#8212;a hundred years old. Oh! your most
      obedient, thinks I!&#8212;if that's the case, it's not for my money; so I
      bought this, in lieu of the smoke-dried thing, and had it a bargain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In architecture, Mrs. Rafferty had as good a taste and as much skill as in
      painting. There had been a handsome portico in front of the house; but
      this interfering with the lady's desire to have a veranda, which she said
      could not be dispensed with, she had raised the whole portico to the
      second story, where it stood, or seemed to stand, upon a tarpaulin roof.
      But Mrs. Raffarty explained that the pillars, though they looked so
      properly substantial, were really hollow and as light as feathers, and
      were supported with cramps, without DISOBLIGING the front wall of the
      house at all to signify.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Before she showed the company any farther,' she said, 'she must premise
      to his lordship, that she had been originally stinted in room for her
      improvements, so that she could not follow her genius liberally; she had
      been reduced to have some things on a confined scale, and occasionally to
      consult her pocket-compass; but she prided herself upon having put as much
      into a light pattern as could well be; that had been her whole ambition,
      study, and problem, for she was determined to have at least the honour of
      having a little TASTE of everything at Tusculum.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So she led the way to a little conservatory, and a little pinery, and a
      little grapery, and a little aviary, and a little pheasantry, and a little
      dairy for show, and a little cottage for ditto, with a grotto full of
      shells, and a little hermitage full of earwigs, and a little ruin full of
      looking-glass, 'to enlarge and multiply the effect of the Gothic.' 'But
      you could only put your head in, because it was just fresh painted, and
      though there had been a fire ordered in the ruin all night, it had only
      smoked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In all Mrs. Raffarty's buildings, whether ancient or modern, there was a
      studied crookedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said, 'she hated everything straight, it was so formal and
      UNPICTURESQUE. Uniformity and conformity, she observed, had their day; but
      now, thank the stars of the present day, irregularity and deformity bear
      the bell, and have the majority.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded and walked through the grounds, from which Mrs.
      Raffarty, though she had done her best, could not take that which nature
      had given, she pointed out to my lord 'a happy moving termination,'
      consisting of a Chinese bridge, with a fisherman leaning over the rails.
      On a sudden, the fisherman was seen to tumble over the bridge into the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen ran to extricate the poor fellow, while they heard Mrs.
      Raffarty bawling to his lordship, to beg he would never mind, and not
      trouble himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at the bridge, they saw the man hanging from part of the
      bridge, and apparently struggling in the water; but when they attempted to
      pull him up, they found it was only a stuffed figure which had been pulled
      into the stream by a real fish, which had seized hold of the bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Raffarty, vexed by the fisherman's fall, and by the laughter it
      occasioned, did not recover herself sufficiently to be happily ridiculous
      during the remainder of the walk, nor till dinner was announced, when she
      apologised for 'having changed the collation, at first intended, into a
      dinner, which she hoped would be found no bad substitute, and which she
      flattered herself might prevail on my lord and the gentlemen to sleep, as
      there was no moon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner had two great faults&#8212;profusion and pretension. There was,
      in fact, ten times more on the table than was necessary; and the
      entertainment was far above the circumstances of the person by whom it was
      given; for instance, the dish of fish at the head of the table had been
      brought across the island from Sligo, and had cost five guineas; as the
      lady of the house failed not to make known. But, after all, things were
      not of a piece; there was a disparity between the entertainment and the
      attendants; there was no proportion or fitness of things&#8212;a painful
      endeavour at what could not be attained, and a toiling in vain to conceal
      and repair deficiencies and blunders. Had the mistress of the house been
      quiet; had she, as Mrs. Broadhurst would say, but let things alone, let
      things take their course, all would have passed off with well-bred people;
      but she was incessantly apologising, and fussing, and fretting inwardly
      and outwardly, and directing and calling to her servants&#8212;striving to
      make a butler who was deaf, a boy who was hare-brained, do the business of
      five accomplished footmen of PARTS and FIGURE. The mistress of the house
      called for 'plates, clean plates!-hot plates!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But none did come, when she did call for them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Raffarty called 'Larry! Larry! My lord's plate, there!&#8212;James!
      bread to Captain Bowles!&#8212;James! port wine to the major!&#8212;James!
      James Kenny! James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And panting James toiled after her in vain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At length one course was fairly got through, and after a torturing
      half-hour, the second course appeared, and James Kenny was intent upon one
      thing, and Larry upon another, so that the wine-sauce for the hare was
      spilt by their collision; but, what was worse, there seemed little chance
      that the whole of this second course should ever be placed altogether
      rightly upon the table. Mrs. Raffarty cleared her throat, and nodded, and
      pointed, and sighed, and set Larry after Kenny, and Kenny after Larry; for
      what one did, the other undid; and at last the lady's anger kindled, and
      she spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kenny! James Kenny! set the sea-cale at this corner, and put down the
      grass cross-corners; and match your macaroni yonder with THEM puddens, set&#8212;Ogh!
      James! the pyramid in the middle, can't ye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The pyramid, in changing places, was overturned. Then it was that the
      mistress of the feast, falling back in her seat, and lifting up her hands
      and eyes in despair, ejaculated, 'Oh, James! James!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The pyramid was raised by the assistance of the military engineers, and
      stood trembling again on its base; but the lady's temper could not be so
      easily restored to its equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of errors, which this day's visit exhibited, amused all the
      spectators. But Lord Colambre, after he had smiled, sometimes sighed.&#8212;Similar
      foibles and follies in persons of different rank, fortune, and manner,
      appear to common observers so unlike, that they laugh without scruples of
      conscience in one case, at what in another ought to touch themselves most
      nearly. It was the same desire to appear what they were not, the same vain
      ambition to vie with superior rank and fortune, or fashion, which actuated
      Lady Clonbrony and Mrs. Raffarty; and whilst this ridiculous grocer's wife
      made herself the sport of some of her guests, Lord Colambre sighed, from
      the reflection that what she was to them, his mother was to persons in a
      higher rank of fashion.&#8212;He sighed still more deeply, when he
      considered, that, in whatever station or with whatever fortune,
      extravagance, that is the living beyond our income, must lead to distress
      and meanness, and end in shame and ruin. In the morning, as they were
      riding away from Tusculum and talking over their visit, the officers
      laughed heartily, and rallying Lord Colambre upon his seriousness, accused
      him of having fallen in love with Mrs. Raffarty, or with the ELEGANT Miss
      Juliana. Our hero, who wished never to be nice overmuch, or serious out of
      season, laughed with those that laughed, and endeavoured to catch the
      spirit of the jest. But Sir James Brooke, who now was well acquainted with
      his countenance, and who knew something of the history of his family,
      understood his real feelings, and, sympathising in them, endeavoured to
      give the conversation a new turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look there, Bowles,' said he, as they were just riding into the town of
      Bray; 'look at the barouche, standing at that green door, at the farthest
      end of the town. Is not that Lady Dashfort's barouche?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It looks like what she sported in Dublin last year,' said Bowles; 'but
      you don't think she'd give us the same two seasons? Besides, she is not in
      Ireland, is she? I did not hear of her intending to come over again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon,' said another officer; 'she will come again to so good
      a market, to marry her other daughter. I hear she said, or swore, that she
      will marry the young widow, Lady Isabel, to an Irish nobleman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever she says, she swears, and whatever she swears, she'll do,'
      replied Bowles. 'Have a care, my Lord Colambre; if she sets her heart upon
      you for Lady Isabel, she has you. Nothing can save you. Heart she has
      none, so there you're safe, my lord,' said the other officer; 'but if Lady
      Isabel sets her eye upon you, no basilisk's is surer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But if Lady Dashfort had landed I am sure we should have heard of it, for
      she makes noise enough wherever she goes; especially in Dublin, where all
      she said and did was echoed and magnified, till one could hear of nothing
      else. I don't think she has landed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope to Heaven they may never land again in Ireland!' cried Sir James
      Brooke; 'one worthless woman, especially one worthless Englishwoman of
      rank, does incalculable mischief in a country like this, which looks up to
      the sister country for fashion. For my own part, as a warm friend to
      Ireland, I would rather see all the toads and serpents, and venomous
      reptiles, that St. Patrick carried off in his bag, come back to this
      island, than these two DASHERS. Why, they would bite half the women and
      girls in the kingdom with the rage for mischief, before half the husbands
      and fathers could turn their heads about. And, once bit, there's no cure
      in nature or art.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No horses to this barouche!' cried Captain Bowles.&#8212;'Pray, sir,
      whose carriage is this?' said the captain to a servant who was standing
      beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lady Dashfort, sir, it belongs to,' answered the servant, in rather a
      surly English tone; and turning to a boy who was lounging at the door&#8212;'Pat,
      bid them bring out the horses, for my ladies is in a hurry to get home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bowles stopped to make his servant alter the girths of his horse,
      and to satisfy his curiosity; and the whole party halted. Captain Bowles
      beckoned to the landlord of the inn, who was standing at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So, Lady Dashfort is here again?&#8212;This is her barouche, is not it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, she is&#8212;it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And has she sold her fine horses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, sir&#8212;this is not her carriage at all&#8212;she is not here.
      That is, she is here, in Ireland; but down in the county of Wicklow, on a
      visit. And this is not her own carriage at all;&#8212;that is to say, not
      that which she has with herself, driving; but only just the cast barouche
      like, as she keeps for the lady's maids.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For the lady's maids! that is good! that is new, faith! Sir James, do you
      hear that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, then, and it's true, and not a word of a lie!' said the honest
      landlord. 'And this minute, we've got a directory of five of them
      abigails, sitting within in our house; as fine ladies, as great dashers,
      too, every bit as their principals; and kicking up as much dust on the
      road, every grain!&#8212;Think of them, now! The likes of them, that must
      have four horses, and would not stir a foot with one less!&#8212;As the
      gentleman's gentleman there was telling and boasting to me about now, when
      the barouche was ordered for them, there at the lady's house, where Lady
      Dashfort is on a visit&#8212;they said they would not get in till they'd
      get four horses; and their ladies backed them; and so the four horses was
      got; and they just drove out here, to see the points of view for fashion's
      sake, like their betters; and up with their glasses, like their ladies;
      and then out with their watches, and "Isn't it time to lunch?" So there
      they have been lunching within on what they brought with them; for nothing
      in our house could they touch, of course! They brought themselves a
      PICKNICK lunch, with Madeira and Champagne to wash it down. Why,
      gentlemen, what do you think, but a set of them, as they were bragging to
      me, turned out of a boarding-house at Cheltenham, last year, because they
      had not peach-pies to their lunch!&#8212;But here they come! shawls, and
      veils, and all!&#8212;streamers flying! But mum is my cue!&#8212;Captain,
      are these girths to your fancy now?' said the landlord, aloud; then, as he
      stooped to alter a buckle, he said, in a voice meant to be heard only by
      Captain Bowles, 'If there's a tongue, male or female, in the three
      kingdoms, it's in that foremost woman, Mrs. Petito.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Petito!' repeated Lord Colambre, as the name caught his ear; and,
      approaching the barouche in which the five abigails were now seated, he
      saw the identical Mrs. Petito, who, when he left London, had been in his
      mother's service.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognised his lordship with very gracious intimacy; and, before he
      had time to ask any questions, she answered all she conceived he was going
      to ask, and with a volubility which justified the landlord's eulogium of
      her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord! I left my Lady Clonbrony some time back&#8212;the day after
      you left town; and both her ladyship and Miss Nugent was charmingly, and
      would have sent their loves to your lordship, I'm sure, if they'd any
      notion I should have met you, my lord, so soon. And I was very sorry to
      part with them; but the fact was, my lord,' said Mrs. Petito, laying a
      detaining hand upon Lord Colambre's whip, one end of which he unwittingly
      trusted within her reach,&#8212;'I and my lady had a little difference,
      which the best friends, you know, sometimes have; so my Lady Clonbrony was
      so condescending to give me up to my Lady Dashfort&#8212;and I knew no
      more than the child unborn that her ladyship had it in contemplation to
      cross the seas. But, to oblige my lady, and as Colonel Heathcock, with his
      regiment of militia, was coming for purtection in the packet at the same
      time, and we to have the government-yacht, I waived my objections to
      Ireland. And, indeed, though I was greatly frighted at first, having heard
      all we've heard, you know, my lord, from Lady Clonbrony, of there being no
      living in Ireland, and expecting to see no trees nor accommodation, nor
      anything but bogs all along; yet I declare, I was very agreeably
      surprised; for, as far as I've seen at Dublin and in the vicinity, the
      accommodations, and everything of that nature, now is vastly put-up-able
      with!'&#8212;'My lord,' said Sir James Brooke, 'we shall be late.' Lord
      Colambre, shortly withdrawing his whip from Mrs. Petito, turned his horse
      away. She, stretching over the back of the barouche as he rode off, bawled
      to him&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, we're at Stephen's Green, when we're at Dublin.' But as he did
      not choose to hear, she raised her voice to its highest pitch, adding&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'And where are you, my lord, to be found!&#8212;as I have a parcel of Miss
      Nugent's for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre instantly turned back, and gave his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cleverly done, faith!' said the major. 'I did not hear her say when Lady
      Dashfort is to be in town,' said Captain Bowles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, Bowles! have you a mind to lose more of your guineas to Lady
      Dashfort, and to be jockied out of another horse by Lady Isabel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! confound it&#8212;no! I'll keep out of the way of that&#8212;I have
      had enough,' said Captain Bowles; 'it is my Lord Colambre's turn now; you
      hear that Lady Dashfort would be very PROUD to see him. His lordship is in
      for it, and with such an auxiliary as Mrs. Petito, Lady Dashfort has him
      for Lady Isabel, as sure as he has a heart or hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My compliments to the ladies, but my heart is engaged,' said Lord
      Colambre; 'and my hand shall go with my heart, or not at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Engaged! engaged to a very amiable, charming woman, no doubt,' said Sir
      James Brooke. 'I have an excellent opinion of your taste; and if you can
      return the compliment to my judgment, take my advice: don't trust to your
      heart's being engaged, much less plead that engagement; for it would be
      Lady Dashfort's sport, and Lady Isabel's joy, to make you break your
      engagement, and break your mistress's heart; the fairer, the more amiable,
      the more beloved, the greater the triumph, the greater the delight in
      giving pain. All the time love would be out of the question; neither
      mother nor daughter would care if you were hanged, or, as Lady Dashfort
      would herself have expressed it, if you were d-d.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With such women, I should think a man's heart could be in no great
      danger,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There you might be mistaken, my lord; there's a way to every man's heart,
      which no man in his own case is aware of, but which every woman knows
      right well, and none better than these ladies&#8212;by his vanity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True,' said Captain Bowles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not so vain as to think myself without vanity,' said Lord Colambre;
      'but love, I should imagine, is a stronger passion than vanity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should imagine! Stay till you are tried, my lord. Excuse me,' said
      Captain Bowles, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre felt the good sense of this, and determined to have nothing
      to do with these dangerous ladies; indeed, though he had talked, he had
      scarcely yet thought of them; for his imagination was intent upon that
      packet from Miss Nugent, which Mrs. Petito said she had for him. He heard
      nothing of it, or of her, for some days. He sent his servant every day to
      Stephen's Green to inquire if Lady Dashfort had returned to town. Her
      ladyship at last returned; but Mrs. Petito could not deliver the parcel to
      any hand but Lord Colambre's own, and she would not stir out, because her
      lady was indisposed. No longer able to restrain his impatience, Lord
      Colambre went himself&#8212;knocked at Lady Dashfort's door&#8212;inquired
      for Mrs. Petito&#8212;was shown into her parlour. The parcel was delivered
      to him; but to his utter disappointment, it was a parcel FOR, not FROM
      Miss Nugent. It contained merely an odd volume of some book of Miss
      Nugent's which Mrs. Petito said she had put up along with her things IN A
      MISTAKE, and she thought it her duty to return it by the next opportunity
      of a safe conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Lord Colambre, to comfort himself for his disappointment, was
      fixing his eyes upon Miss Nugent's name, written by her own hand, in the
      first leaf of the book, the door opened, and the figure of an
      interesting-looking woman, in deep mourning, appeared&#8212;appeared for
      one moment, and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only my Lord Colambre, about a parcel I was bringing for him from
      England, my lady&#8212;my Lady Isabel, my lord,' said Mrs. Petito. Whilst
      Mrs. Petito was saying this, the entrance and retreat had been made, and
      made with such dignity, grace, and modesty; with such innocence, dove-like
      eyes had been raised upon him, fixed and withdrawn; with such a gracious
      bend the Lady Isabel had bowed to him as she retired; with such a smile,
      and with so soft a voice, had repeated 'Lord Colambre!' that his lordship,
      though well aware that all this was mere acting, could not help saying to
      himself as he left the house:
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a pity it is only acting. There is certainly something very
      engaging in this woman. It is a pity she is an actress. And so young! A
      much younger woman than I expected. A widow before most women are wives.
      So young, surely she cannot be such a fiend as they described her to be!'
      A few nights afterwards Lord Colambre was with some of his acquaintance at
      the theatre, when Lady Isabel and her mother came into the box, where
      seats had been reserved for them, and where their appearance instantly
      made that sensation which is usually created by the entrance of persons of
      the first notoriety in the fashionable world. Lord Colambre was not a man
      to be dazzled by fashion, or to mistake notoriety for deference paid to
      merit, and for the admiration commanded by beauty or talents. Lady
      Dashfort's coarse person, loud voice, daring manners, and indelicate wit,
      disgusted him almost past endurance, He saw Sir James Brooke in the box
      opposite to him; and twice determined to go round to him. His lordship had
      crossed the benches, and once his hand was upon the lock of the door; but
      attracted as much by the daughter as repelled by the mother, he could move
      no farther. The mother's masculine boldness heightened, by contrast, the
      charms of the daughter's soft sentimentality. The Lady Isabel seemed to
      shrink from the indelicacy of her mother's manners, and seemed peculiarly
      distressed by the strange efforts Lady Dashfort made, from time to time,
      to drag her forward, and to fix upon her the attention of gentlemen.
      Colonel Heathcock, who, as Mrs. Petito had informed Lord Colambre, had
      come over with his regiment to Ireland, was beckoned into their box by
      Lady Dashfort, by her squeezed into a seat next to Lady Isabel; but Lady
      Isabel seemed to feel sovereign contempt, properly repressed by
      politeness, for what, in a low whisper to a female friend on the other
      side of her, she called, 'the self-sufficient inanity of this sad
      coxcomb.' Other coxcombs, of a more vivacious style, who stationed
      themselves round her mother, or to whom her mother stretched from box to
      box to talk, seemed to engage no more of Lady Isabel's attention than just
      what she was compelled to give by Lady Dashfort's repeated calls of&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Isabel! Isabel! Colonel G&#8212; Isabel! Lord D&#8212; bowing to you,
      Belie! Belie! Sir Harry B&#8212; Isabel, child, with your eyes on the
      stage? Did you never see a play before? Novice! Major P&#8212;waiting to
      catch your eye this quarter of an hour; and now her eyes gone down to her
      play-bill! Sir Harry, do take it from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Were eyes so radiant only made to read?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel appeared to suffer so exquisitely and so naturally from this
      persecution, that Lord Colambre said to himself&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'If this be acting, it is the best acting I ever saw. If this be art, it
      deserves to be nature.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this sentiment he did himself the honour of handing Lady Isabel
      to her carriage this night, and with this sentiment he awoke next morning;
      and by the time he had dressed and breakfasted he determined that it was
      impossible all that he had seen could be acting. 'No woman, no young
      woman, could have such art. Sir James Brooke had been unwarrantably
      severe; he would go and tell him so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir James Brooke this day received orders for his regiment to march to
      quarters in a distant part of Ireland. His head was full of arms, and
      ammunition, and knapsacks, and billets, and routes; and there was no
      possibility, even in the present chivalrous disposition of our hero, to
      enter upon the defence of the Lady Isabel. Indeed, in the regret he felt
      for the approaching and unexpected departure of his friend, Lord Colambre
      forgot the fair lady. But just when Sir James had his foot in the stirrup,
      he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the bye, my dear lord, I saw you at the play last night. You seemed to
      be much interested. Don't think me impertinent, if I remind you of our
      conversation when we were riding home from Tusculum; and if I warn you,'
      said he, mounting his horse, 'to beware of counterfeits&#8212;for such are
      abroad.' Reining in his impatient steed, Sir James turned again and added,
      'DEEDS NOT WORDS, is my motto. Remember, we can judge better by the
      conduct of people towards others than by their manner towards ourselves.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our hero was quite convinced of the good sense of his friend's last
      remark, that it is safer to judge of people by their conduct to others
      than by their manners towards ourselves; but as yet, he felt scarcely any
      interest on the subject of Lady Dashfort or Lady Isabel's characters;
      however, he inquired and listened to all the evidence he could obtain
      respecting this mother and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard terrible reports of the mischief they had done in families; the
      extravagance into which they had led men; the imprudence, to say no worse,
      into which they had betrayed women. Matches broken off, reputations
      ruined, husbands alienated from their wives, and wives made jealous of
      their husbands. But in some of these stories he discovered exaggeration so
      flagrant as to make him doubt the whole; in others, it could not be
      positively determined whether the mother or daughter had been the person
      most to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre always followed the charitable rule of believing only half
      what the world says, and here he thought it fair to believe which half he
      pleased. He further observed, that, though all joined in abusing these
      ladies in their absence, when present they seemed universally admired.
      Though everybody cried 'Shame!' and 'shocking!' yet everybody visited
      them. No parties so crowded as Lady Dashfort's; no party deemed pleasant
      or fashionable where Lady Dashfort or Lady Isabel was not. The bon-mots of
      the mother were everywhere repeated; the dress and air of the daughter
      everywhere imitated. Yet Lord Colambre could not help being surprised at
      their popularity in Dublin, because, independently of all moral
      objections, there were causes of a different sort, sufficient, he thought,
      to prevent Lady Dashfort from being liked by the Irish; indeed by any
      society. She in general affected to be ill-bred, and inattentive to the
      feelings and opinions of others; careless whom she offended by her wit or
      by her decided tone. There are some persons in so high a region of
      fashion, that they imagine themselves above the thunder of vulgar censure.
      Lady Dashfort felt herself in this exalted situation, and fancied she
      might 'hear the innocuous thunder roll below.' Her rank was so high that
      none could dare to call her vulgar; what would have been gross in any one
      of meaner note, in her was freedom, or originality, or Lady Dashfort's
      way. It was Lady Dashfort's pleasure and pride to show her power in
      perverting the public taste. She often said to those English companions
      with whom she was intimate, 'Now see what follies I can lead these fools
      into. Hear the nonsense I can make them repeat as wit.' Upon some
      occasion, one of her friends VENTURED to fear that something she had said
      was TOO STRONG. 'Too strong, was it? Well, I like to be strong&#8212;woe
      be to the weak.' On another occasion she was told that certain visitors
      had seen her ladyship yawning. 'Yawn, did I?&#8212;glad of it&#8212;the
      yawn sent them away, or I should have snored;&#8212;rude, was I? they
      won't complain. To say I was rude to them would be to say, that I did not
      think it worth my while to be otherwise. Barbarians! are not we the
      civilised English, come to teach them manners and fashions? Whoever does
      not conform, and swear allegiance too, we shall keep out of the English
      pale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dashfort forced her way, and she set the fashion: fashion, which
      converts the ugliest dress into what is beautiful and charming, governs
      the public mode in morals and in manners; and thus, when great talents and
      high rank combine, they can debase or elevate the public taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Lord Colambre she played more artfully; she drew him out in defence
      of his beloved country, and gave him opportunities of appearing to
      advantage; this he could not help feeling, especially when the Lady Isabel
      was present. Lady Dashfort had dealt long enough with human nature to
      know, that to make any man pleased with her, she should begin by making
      him pleased with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insensibly the antipathy that Lord Colambre had originally felt to Lady
      Dashfort wore off; her faults, he began to think, were assumed; he
      pardoned her defiance of good breeding, when he observed that she could,
      when she chose it, be most engagingly polite. It was not that she did not
      know what was right, but that she did not think it always for her interest
      to practise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party opposed to Lady Dashfort affirmed that her wit depended merely
      on unexpectedness; a characteristic which may be applied to any
      impropriety of speech, manner, or conduct. In some of her ladyship's
      repartees, however, Lord Colambre now acknowledged there was more than
      unexpectedness; there was real wit; but it was of a sort utterly unfit for
      a woman, and he was sorry that Lady Isabel should hear it. In short,
      exceptionable as it was altogether, Lady Dashfort's conversation had
      become entertaining to him; and though he could never esteem or feel in
      the least interested about her, he began to allow that she could be
      agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, I knew how it would be,' said she, when some of her friends told her
      this. 'He began by detesting me, and did I not tell you that, if I thought
      it worth my while to make him like me, he must, sooner or later. I delight
      in seeing people begin with me as they do with olives, making all manner
      of horrid faces and silly protestations that they will never touch an
      olive again as long as they live; but, after a little time, these very
      folk grow so desperately fond of olives, that there is no dessert without
      them. Isabel, child, you are in the sweet line&#8212;but sweets cloy. You
      never heard of anybody living on marmalade, did ye?'&#8212;Lady Isabel
      answered by a sweet smile.&#8212;'To do you justice, you play Lydia
      Languish vastly well,' pursued the mother; 'but Lydia, by herself, would
      soon tire; somebody must keep up the spirit and bustle, and carry on the
      plot of the piece; and I am that somebody&#8212;as you shall see. Is not
      that our hero's voice, which I hear on the stairs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lord Colambre. His lordship had by this time become a constant
      visitor at Lady Dashfort's. Not that he had forgotten, or that he meant to
      disregard his friend Sir James Brooke's parting words. He promised himself
      faithfully, that if anything should occur to give him reason to suspect
      designs, such as those to which the warning pointed, he would be on his
      guard, and would prove his generalship by an able retreat. But to imagine
      attacks where none were attempted, to suspect ambuscades in the open
      country, would be ridiculous and cowardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' thought our hero; 'Heaven forfend I should be such a coxcomb as to
      fancy every woman who speaks to me has designs upon my precious heart, or
      on my more precious estate!' As he walked from his hotel to Lady
      Dashfort's house, ingeniously wrong, he came to this conclusion, just as
      he ascended the stairs, and just as her ladyship had settled her future
      plan of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking over the nothings of the day, and after having given two or
      three CUTS at the society of Dublin, with two or three compliments to
      individuals, who, she knew, were favourites with his lordship, she
      suddenly turned to him&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, I think you told me, or my own sagacity discovered, that you
      want to see something of Ireland, and that you don't intend, like most
      travellers, to turn round, see nothing, and go home content.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre assured her ladyship that she had judged him rightly, for,
      that nothing would content him but seeing all that was possible to be seen
      of his native country. It was for this special purpose he came to Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!&#8212;well&#8212;very good purpose&#8212;can't be better; but now,
      how to accomplish it. You know the Portuguese proverb says, "You go to
      hell for the good things you intend to do, and to heaven for those you
      do." Now let us see what you will do. Dublin, I suppose, you've seen
      enough of by this time; through and through&#8212;round and round this
      makes me first giddy and then sick. Let me show you the country&#8212;not
      the face of it, but the body of it&#8212;the people. Not Castle this, or
      Newtown that, but their inhabitants. I know them; I have the key, or the
      picklock to their minds. An Irishman is as different an animal on his
      guard, and off his guard, as a miss in school from a miss out of school. A
      fine country for game, I'll show you; and, if you are a good marksman, you
      may have plenty of shots "at folly as it flies."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre smiled. 'As to Isabel,' pursued her ladyship, 'I shall put
      her in charge of Heathcock, who is going with us. She won't thank me for
      that, but you will. Nay, no fibs, man; you know, I know, as who does not
      that has seen the world, that though a pretty woman is a mighty pretty
      thing, yet she is confoundedly in one's way, when anything else is to be
      seen, heard&#8212;or understood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Every objection anticipated and removed, and so far a prospect held out of
      attaining all the information he desired, with more than all the amusement
      he could have expected, Lord Colambre seemed much tempted to accept the
      invitation; but he hesitated, because, as he said, her ladyship might be
      going to pay visits where he was not acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless you! don't let that be a stumbling-block in the way of your tender
      conscience. I am going to Killpatrickstown, where you'll be as welcome as
      light. You know them, they know you; at least you shall have a proper
      letter of invitation from my Lord and my Lady Killpatrick, and all that.
      And as to the rest, you know a young man is always welcome every-where, a
      young nobleman kindly welcome,&#8212;I won't say such a young man, and
      such a young nobleman, for that might put you to pour bows or your blushes&#8212;but
      NOBILITAS by itself, nobility is enough in all parties, in all families,
      where there are girls, and of course balls, as there are always at
      Killpatrickstown. Don't be alarmed; you shall not be forced to dance, or
      asked to marry. I'll be your security. You shall be at full liberty; and
      it is a house where you can do just what you will. Indeed, I go to no
      others. These Killpatricks are the best creatures in the world; they think
      nothing good or grand enough for me. If I'd let them, they would lay down
      cloth of gold over their bogs for me to walk upon.&#8212;Good-hearted
      beings!' added Lady Dashfort, marking a cloud gathering on Lord Colambre's
      countenance. 'I laugh at them, because I love them. I could not love
      anything I might not laugh at&#8212;your lordship excepted. So you'll come&#8212;that's
      settled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled. Our hero went to Killpatrickstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everything here sumptuous and unfinished, you see,' said Lady Dashfort to
      Lord Colambre, the day after their arrival. 'All begun as if the
      projectors thought they had the command of the mines of Peru, and ended as
      if the possessors had not sixpence; DES ARRANGEMENS PROVISATOIRES,
      temporary expedients; in plain English, MAKE-SHIFTS. Luxuries, enough for
      an English prince of the blood; comforts, not enough for an English woman.
      And you may be sure that great repairs and alterations have gone on to fit
      this house for our reception, and for our English eyes!&#8212;Poor people!&#8212;English
      visitors, in this point of view, are horribly expensive to the Irish. Did
      you ever hear that, in the last century, or in the century before the
      last, to put my story far enough back, so that it shall not touch anybody
      living; when a certain English nobleman, Lord Blank A&#8212;, sent to let
      his Irish friend, Lord Blank B&#8212;, know that he and all his train were
      coming over to pay him a visit; the Irish nobleman, Blank B&#8212;,
      knowing the deplorable condition of his castle, sat down fairly to
      calculate whether it would cost him most to put the building in good and
      sufficient repair, fit to receive these English visitors, or to burn it to
      the ground. He found the balance to be in favour of burning, which was
      wisely accomplished next day. Perhaps Killpatrick would have done well to
      follow this example. Resolve me which is worst, to be burnt out of house
      and home, or to be eaten out of house and home. In this house, above and
      below stairs, including first and second table, housekeeper's room, lady's
      maids' room, butler's room, and gentleman's, one hundred and four people
      sit down to dinner every day, as Petito informs me, beside kitchen boys,
      and what they call CHAR-women who never sit down, but who do not eat or
      waste the less for that; and retainers and friends, friends to the fifth
      and sixth generation, who "must get their bit and their sup;" for, "sure,
      it's only Biddy," they say,' continued Lady Dashfort, imitating their
      Irish brogue, 'find, "sure, 'tis nothing at all, out of all his honour, my
      lord, has. How could he FEEL it! [Feel it: become sensible of it, know
      it.] Long life to him! He's not that way: not a couple in all Ireland, and
      that's saying a great dale, looks less after their own, nor is more
      off-handeder, or open-hearteder, or greater open-house-keepers, NOR [than]
      my Lord and my Lady Killpatrick." Now there's encouragement for a lord and
      a lady to ruin themselves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dashfort imitated the Irish brogue in perfection; boasted that 'she
      was mistress of fourteen different brogues, and had brogues for all
      occasions.' By her mixture of mimickry, sarcasm, exaggeration, and truth,
      she succeeded continually in making Lord Colambre laugh at everything at
      which she wished to make him laugh; at every THING, but not every BODY
      whenever she became personal, he became serious, or at least endeavoured
      to become serious; and if he could not instantly resume the command of his
      risible muscles, he reproached himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is shameful to laugh at these people, indeed, Lady Dashfort, in their
      own house&#8212;these hospitable people, who are entertaining us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Entertaining us! true, and if we are ENTERTAINED, how can we help
      laughing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      All expostulation was thus turned off by a jest, as it was her pride to
      make Lord Colambre laugh in spite of his better feelings and principles.
      This he saw, and this seemed to him to be her sole object; but there he
      was mistaken. OFF-HANDED as she pretended to be, none dealt more in the
      IMPROMPTU FAIT A LOISIR; and mentally short-sighted as she affected to be,
      none had more LONGANIMITY for their own interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her settled purpose to make the Irish and Ireland ridiculous and
      contemptible to Lord Colambre; to disgust him with his native country; to
      make him abandon the wish of residing on his own estate. To confirm him an
      absentee was her object previously to her ultimate plan of marrying him to
      her daughter. Her daughter was poor, she would therefore be glad to GET an
      Irish peer for her; but would be very sorry, she said, to see Isabel
      banished to Ireland; and the young widow declared she could never bring
      herself to be buried alive in Clonbrony Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these considerations, Lady Dashfort received certain hints
      from Mrs. Petito, which worked all to the same point.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes, my lady; I heard a great deal about all that when I was at Lady
      Clonbrony's,' said Petito, one day, as she was attending at her lady's
      toilette, and encouraged to begin chattering. 'And I own I was originally
      under the universal error, that my Lord Colambre was to be married to the
      great heiress, Miss Broadhurst; but I have been converted and reformed on
      that score, and am at present quite in another way and style of thinking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Petito paused, in hopes that her lady would ask, what was her present way
      of thinking? But Lady Dashfort, certain that she would tell her without
      being asked, did not take the trouble to speak, particularly as she did
      not choose to appear violently interested on the subject.&#8212;'My
      present way of thinking,' resumed Petito, 'is in consequence of my having,
      with my own eyes and ears, witnessed and overheard his lordship's
      behaviour and words, the morning he was coming away from LUNNUN for
      Ireland; when he was morally certain nobody was up, nor overhearing, nor
      overseeing him, there did I notice him, my lady, stopping in the
      antechamber, ejaculating over one of Miss Nugent's gloves, which he had
      picked up. "Limerick!" said he, quite loud to himself; for it was a
      Limerick glove, my lady,&#8212;"Limerick!&#8212;dear Ireland! she loves
      you as well as I do!"&#8212;or words to that effect; and then a sigh, and
      downstairs and off: So, thinks I, now the cat's out of the bag. And I
      wouldn't give much myself for Miss Broadhurst's chance of that young lord,
      with all her bank stock, scrip, and OMNUM. Now, I see how the land lies,
      and I'm sorry for it; for she's no FORTIN; and she's so proud, she never
      said a hint to me of the matter; but my Lord Colambre is a sweet
      gentleman; and&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Petito! don't run on so; you must not meddle with what you don't
      understand: the Miss Killpatricks, to be sure, are sweet girls,
      particularly the youngest.'&#8212;Her ladyship's toilette was finished;
      and she left Petito to go down to my Lady Killpatrick's woman, to tell, as
      a very great secret, the schemes that were in contemplation among the
      higher powers, in favour of the youngest of the Miss Killpatricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So Ireland is at the bottom of his heart, is it?' repeated Lady Dashfort
      to herself; 'it shall not be long so.' From this time forward, not a day,
      scarcely an hour passed, but her ladyship did or said something to
      depreciate the country, or its inhabitants, in our hero's estimation. With
      treacherous ability, she knew and followed all the arts of
      misrepresentation; all those injurious arts which his friend, Sir James
      Brooke, had, with such honest indignation, reprobated. She knew how, not
      only to seize the ridiculous points, to make the most respectable people
      ridiculous, but she knew how to select the worst instances, the worst
      exceptions; and to produce them as examples, as precedents, from which to
      condemn whole classes, and establish general false conclusions respecting
      a nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighbourhood of Killpatrickstown, Lady Dashfort said, there were
      several SQUIREENS, or little squires; a race of men who have succeeded to
      the BUCKEENS, described by Young and Crumpe. SQUIREENS are persons who,
      with good long leases, or valuable farms, possess incomes from three to
      eight hundred a year; who keep a pack of hounds; TAKE OUT a commission of
      the peace, sometimes before they can spell (as her ladyship said), and
      almost always before they know anything of law or justice! Busy and loud
      about small matters; JOBBERS AT ASSIZES, combining with one another, and
      trying upon every occasion, public or private, to push themselves forward,
      to the annoyance of their superiors, and the terror of those below them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the usual course of things, these men are not often to be found in the
      society of gentry; except, perhaps, among those gentlemen or noblemen who
      like to see hangers-on at their tables; or who find it for their
      convenience to have underling magistrates, to protect their favourites, or
      to propose and CARRY jobs for them on grand juries. At election times,
      however, these persons rise into sudden importance with all who have views
      upon the county. Lady Dashfort hinted to Lord Killpatrick, that her
      private letters from England spoke of an approaching dissolution of
      Parliament; she knew that, upon this hint, a round of invitations would be
      sent to the squireens; and she was morally certain that they would be more
      disagreeable to Lord Colambre, and give him a worse idea of the country,
      than any other people who could be produced. Day after day some of these
      personages made their appearance; and Lady Dashfort took care to draw them
      out upon the subjects on which she knew that they would show the most
      self-sufficient ignorance, and the most illiberal spirit. This succeeded
      beyond her most sanguine expectations. 'Lord Colambre! how I pity you, for
      being compelled to these permanent sittings after dinner!' said Lady
      Isabel to him one night, when he came late to the ladies from the
      dining-room. 'Lord Killpatrick insisted upon my staying to help him to
      push about that never-ending, still-beginning electioneering bottle,' said
      Lord Colambre. 'Oh! if that were all; if these gentlemen would only drink;&#8212;but
      their conversation! I don't wonder my mother dreads returning to Clonbrony
      Castle, if my father must have such company as this. But, surely, it
      cannot be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, indispensable! Positively indispensable!' cried Lady Dashfort; 'no
      living in Ireland without it. You know, in every country in the world, you
      must live with the people of the country, or be torn to pieces; for my
      part, I should prefer being torn to pieces.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel knew how to take advantage of the contrast
      between their own conversation, and that of the persons by whom Lord
      Colambre was so justly disgusted; they happily relieved his fatigue with
      wit, satire, poetry, and sentiment; so that he every day became more
      exclusively fond of their company; for Lady Killpatrick and the Miss
      Killpatricks were mere commonplace people. In the mornings, he rode or
      walked with Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel: Lady Dashfort, by way of
      fulfilling her promise of showing him the people, used frequently to take
      him into the cabins, and talk to their inhabitants. Lord and Lady
      Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world, had taken
      little pains to improve the condition of their tenants; the few attempts
      they had made were injudicious. They had built ornamented, picturesque
      cottages, within view of their demesne; and favourite followers of the
      family, people with half a century's habit of indolence and dirt, were
      PROMOTED to these fine dwellings. The consequences were such as Lady
      Dashfort delighted to point out; everything let to go to ruin for the want
      of a moment's care, or pulled to pieces for the sake of the most trifling
      surreptitious profit; the people most assisted always appearing
      proportionally wretched and discontented. No one could, with more ease and
      more knowledge of her ground, than Lady Dashfort, do the DISHONOUR of a
      country. In every cabin that she entered, by the first glance of her eye
      at the head, kerchiefed in no comely guise, or by the drawn-down corners
      of the mouth, or by the bit of a broken pipe, which in Ireland never
      characterises STOUT LABOUR, or by the first sound of the voice, the
      drawling accent on 'your honour,' or, 'my lady,' she could distinguish the
      proper objects of her charitable designs, that is to say, those of the old
      uneducated race, whom no one can help, because they will never help
      themselves. To these she constantly addressed herself, making them give,
      in all their despairing tones, a history of their complaints and
      grievances; then asking them questions, aptly contrived to expose their
      habits of self-contradiction, their servility and flattery one moment, and
      their litigious and encroaching spirit the next: thus giving Lord Colambre
      the most unfavourable idea of the disposition and character of the lower
      class of the Irish people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel the while standing by, with the most amiable air of pity, with
      expressions of the finest moral sensibility, softening all her mother
      said, finding ever some excuse for the poor creatures, and following with
      angelic sweetness to heal the wounds her mother inflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Dashfort thought she had sufficiently worked upon Lord
      Colambre's mind to weaken his enthusiasm for his native country, and when
      Lady Isabel had, by the appearance of every virtue, added to a delicate
      preference, if not partiality, for our hero, ingratiated herself into his
      good opinion and obtained an interest in his mind, the wily mother
      ventured an attack of a more decisive nature; and so contrived it was,
      that, if it failed, it should appear to have been made without design to
      injure, and in total ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Lady Dashfort, who in fact was not proud of her family, though
      she pretended to be so, had herself prevailed on, though with much
      difficulty, by Lady Killpatrick, to do the very thing she wanted to do, to
      show her genealogy, which had been beautifully blazoned, and which was to
      be produced as evidence in the lawsuit that brought her to Ireland. Lord
      Colambre stood politely looking on and listening, while her ladyship
      explained the splendid inter-marriages of her family, pointing to each
      medallion that was filled gloriously with noble, and even with royal
      names, till at last she stopped short, and covering one medallion with her
      finger, she said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pass over that, dear Lady Killpatrick. You are not to see that, Lord
      Colambre&#8212;that's a little blot in our scutcheon. You know, Isabel, we
      never talk of that prudent match of great-uncle John's; what could he
      expect by marrying into THAT family, where you know all the men were not
      SANS PEUR, and none of the women SANS REPROCHE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh mamma!' cried Lady Isabel, 'not one exception?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one, Isabel,' persisted Lady Dashfort; 'there was Lady &#8212;, and
      the other sister, that married the man with the long nose; and the
      daughter again, of whom they contrived to make an honest woman, by getting
      her married in time to a BLUE-RIBBAND, and who contrived to get herself
      into Doctors' Commons the very next year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, dear mamma, that is enough, and too much. Oh! pray don't go on,'
      cried Lady Isabel, who had appeared very much distressed during her
      mother's speech. 'You don't know what you are saying; indeed, ma'am, you
      don't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very likely, child; but that compliment I can return to you on the spot,
      and with interest; for you seem to me, at this instant, not to know either
      what you are saying or what you are doing. Come, come, explain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, ma'am&#8212;Pray say so no more; I will explain myself another
      time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, there you are wrong, Isabel; in point of good-breeding, anything is
      better than hints and mystery. Since I have been so unlucky as to touch
      upon the subject, better go through with it, and, with all the boldness of
      innocence ask the question, Are you, my Lord Colambre, or are you not,
      related or connected with any of the St. Omars?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not that I know of,' said Lord Colambre; 'but I really am so bad a
      genealogist, that I cannot answer positively.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I must put the substance of my question into a new form. Have you,
      or have you not, a cousin of the name of Nugent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Nugent!&#8212;Grace Nugent!&#8212;Yes,' said Lord Colambre, with as
      much firmness of voice as he could command, and with as little change of
      countenance as possible; but, as the question came upon him so
      unexpectedly, it was not in his power to answer with an air of absolute
      indifference and composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And her mother was&#8212;' said Lady Dashfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My aunt, by marriage; her maiden name was Reynolds, I think. But she died
      when I was quite a child. I know very little about her. I never saw her in
      my life; but I am certain she was a Reynolds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear lord,' continued Lady Dashfort; 'I am perfectly aware that
      she did take and bear the name of Reynolds; but that was not her maiden
      name&#8212;her maiden name was; but perhaps it is a family secret that has
      been kept, for some good reason from you, and from the poor girl herself;
      the maiden name was St. Omar, depend upon it. Nay, I would not have told
      this to you, my lord, if I could have conceived that it would affect you
      so violently,' pursued Lady Dashfort, in a tone of raillery; 'you see you
      are no worse off than we are. We have an intermarriage with the St. Omars.
      I did not think you would be so much shocked at a discovery, which proves
      that our family and yours have some little connexion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre endeavoured to answer, and mechanically said something
      about, 'happy to have the honour.' Lady Dashfort, truly happy to see that
      her blow had hit the mark so well, turned from his lordship without
      seeming to observe how seriously he was affected; and Lady Isabel sighed,
      and looked with compassion on Lord Colambre, and then reproachfully at her
      mother. But Lord Colambre heeded not her looks, and heard not of her
      sighs; he heard nothing, saw nothing, though his eyes were intently fixed
      on the genealogy, on which Lady Dashfort was still descanting to Lady
      Killpatrick. He took the first opportunity he could of quitting the room,
      and went out to take a solitary walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There he is, departed, but not in peace, to reflect upon what has been
      said,' whispered Lady Dashfort to her daughter. 'I hope it will do him a
      vast deal of good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None of the women SANS REPROCHE! None!&#8212;without one exception,' said
      Lord Colambre to himself; 'and Grace Nugent's mother a St. Omar!&#8212;Is
      it possible? Lady Dashfort seems certain. She could not assert a positive
      falsehood&#8212;no motive. She does not know that Miss Nugent is the
      person to whom I am attached she spoke at random. And I have heard it
      first from a stranger&#8212;not from my mother. Why was it kept secret
      from me? Now I understand the reason why my mother evidently never wished
      that I should think of Miss Nugent&#8212;why she always spoke so
      vehemently against the marriages of relations, of cousins. Why not tell me
      the truth? It would have had the strongest effect, had she known my mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre had the greatest dread of marrying any woman whose mother
      had conducted herself ill. His reason, his prejudices, his pride, his
      delicacy, and even his limited experience, were all against it. All his
      hopes, his plans of future happiness, were shaken to their very
      foundation; he felt as if he had received a blow that stunned his mind,
      and from which he could not recover his faculties. The whole of that day
      he was like one in a dream. At night the painful idea continually recurred
      to him; and whenever he was falling asleep, the sound of Lady Dashfort's
      voice returned upon his ear, saying the words, 'What could he expect when
      he married one of the St. Omars? None of the women SANS REPROCHE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he rose early; and the first thing he did was to write a
      letter to his mother, requesting (unless there was some important reason
      for her declining to answer the question) that she would immediately
      relieve his mind from a great UNEASINESS (he altered the word four times,
      but at last left it UNEASINESS). He stated what he had heard, and besought
      his mother to tell him the whole truth, without reserve.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning Lady Dashfort had formed an ingenious scheme for leaving Lady
      Isabel and Lord Colambre TETE-A-TETE; but the sudden entrance of Heathcock
      disconcerted her intentions. He came to beg Lady Dashfort's interest with
      Count O'Halloran, for permission to hunt and shoot on his grounds.&#8212;'Not
      for myself, 'pon honour, but for two officers who are quartered at the
      next town here, who will indubitably hang or drown themselves if they are
      debarred from sporting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is this Count O'Halloran?' said Lord Colambre. Miss White, Lady
      Killpatrick's companion, said 'he was a great oddity;' Lady Dashfort,
      'that he was singular;' and the clergyman of the parish, who was at
      breakfast, declared 'that he was a man of uncommon knowledge, merit, and
      politeness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All I know of him,' said Heathcock, 'is, that he is a great sportsman,
      with a long queue, a gold-laced hat, and long skirts to a laced
      waistcoat.' Lord Colambre expressed a wish to see this extraordinary
      personage; and Lady Dashfort, to cover her former design, and, perhaps,
      thinking absence might be as effectual as too much propinquity,
      immediately offered to call upon the officers in their way, and carry them
      with Heathcock and Lord Colambre to Halloran Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel retired with much mortification, but with becoming grace; and
      Captain Benson and Captain Williamson were taken to the count's. Captain
      Benson, who was a famous WHIP, took his seat on the box of the barouche,
      and the rest of the party had the pleasure of her ladyship's conversation
      for three or four miles: of her ladyship's conversation&#8212;for Lord
      Colambre's thoughts were far distant; Captain Williamson had not anything
      to say; and Heathcock nothing but, 'Eh! re'lly now!&#8212;'pon honour!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Halloran Castle&#8212;a fine old building, part of it in
      ruins, and part repaired with great judgment and taste. When the carriage
      stopped, a respectable-looking man-servant appeared on the steps, at the
      open hall-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran was out a-hunting; but his servant said 'that he would be
      at home immediately, if Lady Dashfort and the gentlemen would be pleased
      to walk in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of the lofty and spacious hall stood the skeleton of an elk;
      on the other side, the perfect skeleton of a moose-deer, which, as the
      servant said, his master had made out, with great care, from the different
      bones of many of this curious species of deer, found in the lakes in the
      neighbourhood. The brace of officers witnessed their wonder with sundry
      strange oaths and exclamations.&#8212;'Eh! 'pon honour&#8212;re'lly now!'
      said Heathcock; and, too genteel to wonder at or admire anything in the
      creation, dragged out his watch with some difficulty, saying, 'I wonder
      now whether they are likely to think of giving us anything to eat in this
      place?' And, turning his back upon the moose-deer, he straight walked out
      again upon the steps, called to his groom, and began to make some inquiry
      about his led horse. Lord Colambre surveyed the prodigious skeletons with
      rational curiosity, and with that sense of awe and admiration, by which a
      superior mind is always struck on beholding any of the great works of
      Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, my dear lord!' said Lady Dashfort; 'with our sublime sensations, we
      are keeping my old friend, Mr. Alick Brady, this venerable person,
      waiting, to show us into the reception-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed respectfully&#8212;more respectfully than servants of
      modern date.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lady, the reception-room has been lately painted&#8212;the smell of
      paint may be disagreeable; with your leave, I will take the liberty of
      showing you into my master's study.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door, went in before her, and stood holding up his finger,
      as if making a signal of silence to some one within. Her ladyship entered,
      and found herself in the midst of an odd assembly: an eagle, a goat, a
      dog, an otter, several gold and silver fish in a glass globe, and a white
      mouse in a cage. The eagle, quick of eye but quiet of demeanour, was
      perched upon his stand; the otter lay under the table, perfectly harmless;
      the Angora goat, a beautiful and remarkably little creature of its kind,
      with long, curling, silky hair, was walking about the room with the air of
      a beauty and a favourite; the dog, a tall Irish greyhound&#8212;one of the
      few of that fine race which is now almost extinct&#8212;had been given to
      Count O'Halloran by an Irish nobleman, a relation of Lady Dashfort's. This
      dog, who had formerly known her ladyship, looked at her with ears erect,
      recognised her, and went to meet her the moment she entered. The servant
      answered for the peaceable behaviour of all the rest of the company of
      animals, and retired. Lady Dashfort began to feed the eagle from a silver
      plate on his stand; Lord Colambre examined the inscription on his collar;
      the other men stood in amaze. Heathcock, who came in last, astonished out
      of his constant 'Eh! re'lly now!' the moment he put himself in at the
      door, exclaimed, 'Zounds! what's all this live lumber?' and he stumbled
      over the goat, who was at that moment crossing the way. The colonel's spur
      caught in the goat's curly beard; the colonel shook his foot, and
      entangled the spur worse and worse; the goat struggled and butted; the
      colonel skated forward on the polished oak floor, balancing himself with
      outstretched arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignant eagle screamed, and, passing by, perched on Heathcock's
      shoulders. Too well-bred to have recourse to the terrors of his beak, he
      scrupled not to scream, and flap his wings about the colonel's ears. Lady
      Dashfort, the while, threw herself back in her chair, laughing, and
      begging Heathcock's pardon. 'Oh, take care of the dog, my dear colonel!'
      cried she; 'for this kind of dog seizes his enemy by the back, and shakes
      him to death.' The officers, holding their sides, laughed, and begged&#8212;no
      pardon; while Lord Colambre, the only person who was not absolutely
      incapacitated, tried to disentangle the spur, and to liberate the colonel
      from the goat, and the goat from the colonel; an attempt in which he at
      last succeeded, at the expense of a considerable portion of the goat's
      beard. The eagle, however, still kept his place; and, yet mindful of the
      wrongs of his insulted friend the goat, had stretched his wings to give
      another buffet. Count O'Halloran entered; and the bird, quitting his prey,
      flew down to greet his master. The count was a fine old military-looking
      gentleman, fresh from the chace: his hunting accoutrements hanging
      carelessly about him, he advanced, unembarrassed, to the lady; and
      received his other guests with a mixture of military ease and
      gentleman-like dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without adverting to the awkward and ridiculous situation in which he had
      found poor Heathcock, he apologised in general for his troublesome
      favourites. 'For one of them,' said he, patting the head of the dog, which
      lay quiet at Lady Dashfort's feet, 'I see I have no need to apologise; he
      is where he ought to be. Poor fellow! he has never lost his taste for the
      good company to which he was early accustomed. As to the rest,' said he,
      turning to Lady Dashfort, 'a mouse, a bird, and a fish, are, you know,
      tribute from earth, air, and water, for my conqueror&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But from no barbarous Scythian!' said Lord Colambre, smiling. The count
      looked at Lord Colambre, as at a person worthy his attention; but his
      first care was to keep the peace between his loving subjects and his
      foreign visitors. It was difficult to dislodge the old settlers, to make
      room for the newcomers; but he adjusted these things with admirable
      facility; and, with a master's hand and master's eye, compelled each
      favourite to retreat into the back settlements. With becoming attention,
      he stroked and kept quiet old Victory, his eagle, who eyed Colonel
      Heathcock still, as if he did not like him; and whom the colonel eyed, as
      if he wished his neck fairly wrung off. The little goat had nestled
      himself close up to his liberator, Lord Colambre, and lay perfectly quiet,
      with his eyes closed, going very wisely to sleep, and submitting
      philosophically to the loss of one half of his beard. Conversation now
      commenced, and was carried on by Count O'Halloran with much ability and
      spirit, and with such quickness of discrimination and delicacy of taste,
      as quite surprised and delighted our hero. To the lady, the count's
      attention was first directed: he listened to her as she spoke, bending
      with an air of deference and devotion. She made her request for permission
      for Major Benson and Captain Williamson to hunt and shoot in his grounds;
      this was instantly granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her ladyship's requests were to him commands,' the count said. 'His
      gamekeeper should be instructed to give the gentlemen, her friends, every
      liberty, and all possible assistance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to the officers, he said he had just heard that several
      regiments of English militia had lately landed in Ireland; that one
      regiment was arrived at Killpatrickstown. He rejoiced in the advantages
      Ireland, and he hoped he might be permitted to add, England, would
      probably derive from the exchange of the militia of both countries; habits
      would be improved, ideas enlarged. The two countries have the same
      interest; and, from the inhabitants discovering more of each other's good
      qualities, and interchanging little good offices in common life, their
      esteem and affection for each other would increase, and rest upon the firm
      basis of mutual utility.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this Major Benson and Captain Williamson made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The major looks so like a stuffed man of straw,' whispered Lady Dashfort
      to Lord Colambre; 'and the captain so like the knave of clubs, putting
      forth one manly leg.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran now turned the conversation to field sports, and then the
      captain and major opened at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray now, sir?' said the major, 'you fox-hunt in this country, I suppose;
      and now do you manage the thing here as we do? Over night, you know,
      before the hunt, when the fox is out, stopping up the earths of the cover
      we mean to draw, and all the rest for four miles round. Next morning we
      assemble at the cover's side, and the huntsman throws in the hounds. The
      gossip here is no small part of the entertainment; but as soon as we hear
      the hounds give tongue&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The favourite hounds,' interposed Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The favourite hounds, to be sure,' continued Benson; 'there is a dead
      silence, till pug is well out of cover, and the whole pack well in; then
      cheer the hounds with tally-ho! till your lungs crack. Away he goes in
      gallant style, and the whole field is hard up, till pug takes a stiff
      country; then they who haven't pluck lag, see no more of him, and, with a
      fine blazing scent, there are but few of us in at the death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we are fairly in at the death, I hope,' said Lady Dashfort; 'I was
      thrown out sadly at one time in the chace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, with the count's permission, took up a book in which the
      count's pencil lay, PASLEY ON THE MILITARY POLICY OF GREAT BRITAIN; it was
      marked with many notes of admiration, and with hands pointing to
      remarkable passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is a book that leaves a strong impression on the mind,' said the
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre read one of the marked passages, beginning with, 'All that
      distinguishes a soldier in outward appearance from a citizen is so
      trifling&#8212;' but at this instant our hero's attention was distracted
      by seeing in a black-letter book this title of a chapter:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Burial-place of the Nugents.' 'Pray now, sir,' said Captain Williamson,
      'if I don't interrupt you, as you are such a famous fox-hunter, maybe, you
      may be a fisherman too; and now in Ireland do you, MR.&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart pinch on his elbow from his major, who stood behind him, stopped
      the captain short, as he pronounced the word MR. Like all awkward people,
      he turned directly to ask, by his looks, what was the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      The major took advantage of his discomfiture, and, stepping before him,
      determined to have the fishing to himself, and went on with&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Count O'Halloran, I presume you understand fishing too, as well as
      hunting?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The count bowed: 'I do not presume to say that, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But pray, count, in this country, do you arm your hook this ways? Give me
      leave;' taking the whip from Williamson's reluctant hand, 'this ways,
      laying the outermost part of your feather this fashion next to your hook,
      and the point next to your shank, this wise, and that wise; and then, sir,&#8212;count,
      you take the hackle of a cock's neck&#8212;&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A plover's topping's better,' said Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And work your gold and silver thread,' pursued Benson, 'up to your wings,
      and when your head's made, you fasten all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you never showed how your head's made,' interrupted Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The gentleman knows how a head's made; any man can make a head, I
      suppose; so, sir, you fasten all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll never get your head fast on that way, while the world stands,'
      cried Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fast enough for all purposes; I'll bet you a rump and dozen, captain; and
      then, sir,&#8212;count, you divide your wings with a needle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A pin's point will do,' said Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count, to reconcile matters, produced from an Indian cabinet, which he
      had opened for the lady's inspection, a little basket containing a variety
      of artificial flies of curious construction, which, as he spread them on
      the table, made Williamson and Benson's eyes almost sparkle with delight.
      There was the DUN-FLY, for the month of March; and the STONE-FLY, much in
      vogue for April; and the RUDDY-FLY, of red wool, black silk, and red
      capon's feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, whose head was in the burial-place of the Nugents, wished
      them all at the bottom of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the GREEN-FLY, and the MOORISH-FLY!' cried Benson, snatching them up
      with transport; 'and, chief, the SAD-YELLOW-FLY, in which the fish delight
      in June; the SAD-YELLOW-FLY, made with the buzzard's wings, bound with
      black braked hemp, and the SHELL-FLY for the middle of July, made of
      greenish wool, wrapped about with the herle of a peacock's tail, famous
      for creating excellent sport.' All these and more were spread upon the
      table before the sportsmen's wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital flies! capital, faith!' cried Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Treasures, faith, real treasures, by G&#8212;!' cried Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh! 'pon honour! re'lly now,' were the first words which Heathcock had
      uttered since his battle with the goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Heathcock, are you alive still?' said Lady Dashfort; 'I had
      really forgotten your existence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So had Count O'Halloran, but he did not say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your ladyship has the advantage of me there,' said Heathcock, stretching
      himself; 'I wish I could forget my existence, for, in my mind, existence
      is a horrible BORE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought you WAS a sportsman,' said Williamson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a fisherman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, look you there, sir,' pointing to the flies, 'and tell a body life's
      a bore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One can't ALWAYS fish, or shoot, I apprehend, sir,' said Heathcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not always&#8212;but sometimes,' said Williamson, laughing; 'for I
      suspect shrewdly you've forgot some of your sporting in Bond Street.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh! 'pon honour! re'lly now!' said the colonel, retreating again to his
      safe entrenchment of affectation, from which he never could venture
      without imminent danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon honour,' cried Lady Dashfort, 'I can swear for Heathcock, that I
      have eaten excellent hares and ducks of his shooting, which, to my
      knowledge,' added she, in a loud whisper, 'he bought in the market.'
    </p>
    <p>
      EMPTUM APRUM!' said Lord Colambre to the count, without danger of being
      understood by those whom it concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count smiled a second time; but politely turning the attention of the
      company from the unfortunate colonel by addressing himself to the laughing
      sportsmen, 'Gentlemen, you seem to value these,' said he, sweeping the
      artificial flies from the table into the little basket from which they had
      been taken; 'would you do me the honour to accept of them? They are all of
      my own making, and consequently of Irish manufacture.' Then, ringing the
      bell, he asked Lady Dashfort's permission to have the basket put into her
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benson and Williamson followed the servant, to prevent them from being
      tossed into the boot. Heathcock stood still in the middle of the room
      taking snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran turned from him to Lord Colambre, who had just got
      happily to THE BURIAL-PLACE OF THE NUGENTS, when Lady Dashfort, coming
      between them, and spying the title of the chapter, exclaimed&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have you there?&#8212;Antiquities! my delight!&#8212;but I never
      look at engravings when I can see realities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was then compelled to follow, as she led the way into the
      hall, where the count took down golden ornaments, and brass-headed spears,
      and jointed horns of curious workmanship, that had been found on his
      estate; and he told of spermaceti wrapped in carpets, and he showed small
      urns, enclosing ashes; and from among these urns he selected one, which he
      put into the hands of Lord Colambre, telling him that it had been lately
      found in an old abbey-ground in his neighbourhood, which had been the
      burial-place of some of the Nugent family.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was just looking at the account of it, in the book which you saw open
      on my table.&#8212;And as you seem to take an interest in that family, my
      lord, perhaps,' said the count, 'you may think this urn worth your
      acceptance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre said, 'It would be highly valuable to him&#8212;as the
      Nugents were his near relations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dashfort little expected this blow; she, however, carried him off to
      the moose-deer, and from moose-deer to round-towers, to various
      architectural antiquities, and to the real and fabulous history of
      Ireland, on all which the count spoke with learning and enthusiasm. But
      now, to Colonel Heathcock's great joy and relief, a handsome collation
      appeared in the dining-room, of which Ulick opened the folding-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Count, you have made an excellent house of your castle,' said Lady
      Dashfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be, when it is finished,' said the count. 'I am afraid,' added
      he, smiling, 'I live like many other Irish gentlemen, who never are, but
      always to be, blest with a good house. I began on too large a scale, and
      can never hope to live to finish it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon honour! here's a good thing, which I hope we shall live to finish,'
      said Heathcock, sitting down before the collation; and heartily did he eat
      of grouse pie, and of Irish ortolans, which, as Lady Dashfort observed,
      'afforded him indemnity for the past, and security for the future.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh! re'lly now! your Irish ortolans are famous good eating,' said
      Heathcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Worth being quartered in Ireland, faith! to taste 'em,' said Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count recommended to Lady Dashfort some of 'that delicate sweetmeat,
      the Irish plum.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless me, sir&#8212;count!' cried Williamson, 'it's by far the best thing
      of the kind I ever tasted in all my life: where could you get this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In Dublin, at my dear Mrs. Godey's; where ONLY, in his Majesty's
      dominions, it is to be had,' said the count. The whole dish vanished in a
      few seconds. ''Pon honour! I do believe this is the thing the queen's so
      fond of,' said Heathcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then heartily did he drink of the count's excellent Hungarian wines; and,
      by the common bond of sympathy between those who have no other tastes but
      eating and drinking, the colonel, the major, and the captain were now all
      the best companions possible for one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst 'they prolonged the rich repast,' Lady Dashfort and Lord Colambre
      went to the window to admire the prospect; Lady Dashfort asked the count
      the name of some distant hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' said the count, 'that hill was once covered with fine wood; but it
      was all cut down two years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who could have been so cruel?' said her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I forget the present proprietor's name,' said the count; 'but he is one
      of those who, according to THE CLAUSE OF DISTRESS in their leases, LEAD,
      DRIVE, AND CARRY AWAY, but never ENTER their lands; one of those enemies
      to Ireland&#8212;these cruel absentees!' Lady Dashfort looked through her
      glass at the mountain; Lord Colambre sighed, and, endeavouring to pass it
      off with a smile, said frankly to the count&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not aware, I am sure, count, that you are speaking to the son of
      an Irish absentee family.&#8212;Nay, do not be shocked, my dear sir; I
      tell you only, because I thought it fair to do so; but let me assure you,
      that nothing you could say on that subject could hurt me personally,
      because I feel that I am not, that I never can be, an enemy to Ireland. An
      absentee, voluntarily, I never yet have been; and as to the future, I
      declare&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I declare you know nothing of the future,' interrupted Lady Dashfort, in
      a half-peremptory, half-playful tone&#8212;'you know nothing; make no rash
      vows, and you will break none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The undaunted assurance of Lady Dashfort's genius for intrigue gave her an
      air of frank imprudence, which prevented Lord Colambre from suspecting
      that more was meant than met the ear. The count and he took leave of one
      another with mutual regard; and Lady Dashfort rejoiced to have got our
      hero out of Halloran Castle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre had waited with great impatience for an answer to the letter
      of inquiry which he had written about Miss Nugent's mother. A letter from
      Lady Clonbrony arrived; he opened it with the greatest eagerness&#8212;passed
      over 'Rheumatism warm weather&#8212;warm bath&#8212;Buxton balls&#8212;Miss
      Broadhurst&#8212;your FRIEND, Sir Arthur Berryl, very assiduous!' The name
      of Grace Nugent he found at last, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother's maiden name was ST. OMAR; and there was a FAUX PAS,
      certainly. She was, I am told (for it was before my time), educated at a
      convent abroad; and there was an affair with a Captain Reynolds, a young
      officer, which her friends were obliged to hush up. She brought an infant
      to England with her, and took the name of Reynolds&#8212;but none of that
      family would acknowledge her; and she lived in great obscurity, till your
      uncle Nugent saw, fell in love with her, and (knowing her whole history)
      married her. He adopted the child, gave her his name, and, after some
      years, the whole story was forgotten. Nothing could be more
      disadvantageous to Grace than to have it revived: this is the reason we
      kept it secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre tore the letter to bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the perturbation which Lady Dashfort saw in his countenance, she
      guessed the nature of the letter which he had been reading, and for the
      arrival of which he had been so impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has worked!' said she to herself. 'POUR LE COUP PHILIPPE JE TE TIENS!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre appeared this day more sensible, than he had ever yet
      seemed, to the charms of the fair Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Many a tennis-ball, and many a heart is caught at the rebound,' said Lady
      Dashfort. 'Isabel! now is your time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was&#8212;or so, perhaps, it would have been, but for a
      circumstance which her ladyship, with all her genius for intrigue, had
      never taken into her consideration. Count O'Halloran came to return the
      visit which had been paid to him; and, in the course of conversation, he
      spoke of the officers who had been introduced to him, and told Lady
      Dashfort that he had heard a report which shocked him much&#8212;he hoped
      it could not be true&#8212;that one of these officers had introduced his
      mistress as his wife to Lady Oranmore, who lived in the neighbourhood.
      This officer, it was said, had let Lady Oranmore send her carriage for
      this woman; and that she had dined at Oranmore with her ladyship and her
      daughters. [Fact.] 'But I cannot believe it! I cannot believe it to be
      possible, that any gentleman, that any officer, could do such a thing!'
      said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And is this all?' exclaimed Lady Dashfort. 'Is this all the terrible
      affair, my good count, which has brought your face to this prodigious
      length?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The count looked at Lady Dashfort with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a look of virtuous indignation,' continued she, 'did I never behold,
      on or off the stage. Forgive me for laughing, count; but, believe me,
      comedy goes through the world better than tragedy, and, take it all in
      all, does rather less mischief. As to the thing in question, I know
      nothing about it: I dare say, it is not true; but, now, suppose it was&#8212;it
      is only a silly QUIZ, of a raw young officer, upon a prudish old dowager.
      I know nothing about it, for my part; but, after all, what irreparable
      mischief has been done? Laugh at the thing, and then it is a jest&#8212;a
      bad one, perhaps, but still only a jest&#8212;and there's an end of it;
      but take it seriously, and there is no knowing where it might end&#8212;in
      half a dozen duels, maybe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of that, madam,' said the count, 'Lady Oranmore's prudence and presence
      of mind have prevented all danger. Her ladyship WOULD not understand the
      insult. She said, or she acted as if she said, "JE NE VEUX RIEN VOIR, RIEN
      ECOUTER, RIEN SAVOIR." Lady Oranmore is one of the most respectable&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Count, I beg your pardon!' interrupted Lady Dashfort; 'but I must tell
      you that your favourite, Lady Oranmore, has behaved very ill to me;
      purposely omitted to invite Isabel to her ball; offended and insulted me:&#8212;her
      praises, therefore, cannot be the most agreeable subject of conversation
      you can choose for my amusement; and as to the rest, you, who have such
      variety and so much politeness, will, I am sure, have the goodness to
      indulge my caprice in this instance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall obey your ladyship, and be silent, whatever pleasure it might give
      me to speak on that subject,' said the count; 'and I trust Lady Dashfort
      will reward me by the assurance that, however playfully she may have just
      now spoken, she seriously disapproves and is shocked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, shocked! shocked to death! if that will satisfy you, my dear count.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The count, obviously, was not satisfied; he had civil, as well as military
      courage, and his sense of right and wrong could stand against the raillery
      and ridicule of a fine lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation ended: Lady Dashfort thought it would have no further
      consequences; and she did not regret the loss of a man like Count
      O'Halloran, who lived retired in his castle, and who could not have any
      influence upon the opinion of the fashionable world. However, upon turning
      from the count to Lord Colambre, who she thought had been occupied with
      Lady Isabel, and to whom she imagined all this dispute was uninteresting,
      she perceived, by his countenance, that she had made a great mistake.
      Still she trusted that her power over Lord Colambre was sufficient easily
      to efface whatever unfavourable impression this conversation had made upon
      his mind. He had no personal interest in the affair; and she had generally
      found that people are easily satisfied about any wrong or insult, public
      or private, in which they have no immediate concern. But all the charms of
      her conversation were now tried in vain to reclaim him from the reverie
      into which he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend Sir James Brooke's parting advice occurred to our hero; his
      eyes began to open to Lady Dashfort's character; and he was, from this
      moment, freed from her power. Lady Isabel, however, had taken no part in
      all this&#8212;she was blameless; and, independently of her mother, and in
      pretended opposition of sentiment, she might have continued to retain the
      influence she had gained over Lord Colambre, but that a slight accident
      revealed to him her real disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, on the evening of this day, that Lady Isabel came into the
      library with one of the young ladies of the house, talking very eagerly,
      without perceiving Lord Colambre, who was sitting in one of the recesses
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear creature, you are quite mistaken,' said Lady Isabel, 'he was
      never a favourite of mine; I always detested him; I only flirted with him
      to plague his wife. Oh that wife, my dear Elizabeth, I do hate!' cried
      she, clasping her hands, and expressing hatred with all her soul and with
      all her strength. 'I detest that Lady de Cresey to such a degree, that, to
      purchase the pleasure of making her feel the pangs of jealousy for one
      hour, look, I would this moment lay down this finger and let it be cut
      off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The face, the whole figure of Lady Isabel at this moment appeared to Lord
      Colambre suddenly metamorphosed; instead of the soft, gentle, amiable
      female, all sweet charity and tender sympathy, formed to love and to be
      loved, he beheld one possessed and convulsed by an evil spirit&#8212;her
      beauty, if beauty it could be called, the beauty of a fiend. Some
      ejaculation, which he unconsciously uttered, made Lady Isabel start. She
      saw him&#8212;saw the expression of his countenance, and knew that all was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, to the utter astonishment and disappointment of Lady
      Dashfort, and to the still greater mortification of Lady Isabel, announced
      this night that it was necessary he should immediately pursue his tour in
      Ireland. We pass over all the castles in the air which the young ladies of
      the family had built, and which now fell to the ground. We pass all the
      civil speeches of Lord and Lady Killpatrick; all the vehement
      remonstrances of Lady Dashfort; and the vain sighs of Lady Isabel, To the
      last moment Lady Dashfort said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will not go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But he went; and, when he was gone, Lady Dashfort exclaimed, 'That man has
      escaped from me.' And after a pause, turning to her daughter, she, in the
      most taunting and contemptuous terms, reproached her as the cause of this
      failure, concluding by a declaration that she must in future manage her
      own affairs, and had best settle her mind to marry Heathcock, since every
      one else was too wise to think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel of course retorted. But we leave this amiable mother and
      daughter to recriminate in appropriate terms, and we follow our hero,
      rejoiced that he has been disentangled from their snares. Those who have
      never been in similar peril will wonder much that he did not escape
      sooner; those who have ever been in like danger will wonder more that he
      escaped at all. Those who are best acquainted with the heart or
      imagination of man will be most ready to acknowledge that the combined
      charms of wit, beauty, and flattery, may, for a time, suspend the action
      of right reason in the mind of the greatest philosopher, or operate
      against the resolutions of the greatest of heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre pursued his way to Castle Halloran, desirous, before he
      quitted this part of the country, to take leave of the count, who had
      shown him much civility, and for whose honourable conduct, and generous
      character, he had conceived a high esteem, which no little peculiarities
      of antiquated dress or manner could diminish. Indeed, the old-fashioned
      politeness of what was formerly called a well-bred gentleman pleased him
      better than the indolent or insolent selfishness of modern men of the ton.
      Perhaps, notwithstanding our hero's determination to turn his mind from
      everything connected with the idea of Miss Nugent, some latent curiosity
      about the burial-place of the Nugents might have operated to make him call
      upon the count. In this hope he was disappointed; for a cross miller to
      whom the abbey-ground was set, on which the burial-place was found, had
      taken it into his head to refuse admittance, and none could enter his
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran was much pleased by Lord Colambre's visit. The very day
      of Lord Colambre's arrival at Halloran Castle, the count was going to
      Oranmore; he was dressed, and his carriage was waiting; therefore Lord
      Colambre begged that he might not detain him, and the count requested his
      lordship to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me have the honour of introducing you, my lord, to a family, with
      whom, I am persuaded, you will be pleased; by whom you will be
      appreciated; and at whose house you will have an opportunity of seeing the
      best manner of living of the Irish nobility.' Lord Colambre accepted the
      invitation, and was introduced at Oranmore. The dignified appearance and
      respectable character of Lady Oranmore; the charming unaffected manners of
      her daughters; the air of domestic happiness and comfort in her family;
      the becoming magnificence, free from ostentation, in her whole
      establishment; the respect and affection with which she was treated by all
      who approached her, delighted and touched Lord Colambre; the more,
      perhaps, because he had heard this family so unjustly abused; and because
      he saw Lady Oranmore and her daughter, in immediate contrast to Lady
      Dashfort and Lady Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little circumstance which occurred during this visit increased his
      interest for the family. When Lady de Cresey's little boys came in after
      dinner, one of them was playing with a seal, which had just been torn from
      a letter. The child showed it to Lord Colambre, and asked him to read the
      motto. The motto was, 'Deeds, not words'&#8212;his friend Sir James
      Brooke's motto, and his arms. Lord Colambre eagerly inquired if this
      family was acquainted with Sir James, and he soon perceived that they were
      not only acquainted with him, but that they were particularly interested
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Oranmore's second daughter, Lady Harriet, appeared particularly
      pleased by the manner in which Lord Colambre spoke of Sir James. And the
      child, who had now established himself on his lordship's knee, turned
      round, and whispered in his ear, ''Twas Aunt Harriet gave me the seal; Sir
      James is to be married to Aunt Harriet, and then he will be my uncle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the principal gentry of this part of the country happened to dine
      at Oranmore one of the days Lord Colambre was there. He was surprised at
      the discovery, that there were so many agreeable, well-informed, and
      well-bred people, of whom, while he was at Killpatrickstown, he had seen
      nothing. He now discerned how far he had been deceived by Lady Dashfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the count, and Lord and Lady Oranmore, who were warmly attached to
      their country, exhorted him to make himself amends for the time he had
      lost, by seeing with his own eyes, and judging with his own understanding,
      of the country and its own inhabitants, during the remainder of the time
      he was to stay in Ireland. The higher classes, in most countries, they
      observed were generally similar; but, in the lower class, he would find
      many characteristic differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first came to Ireland, he had been very eager to go and see his
      father's estate, and to judge of the conduct of his agents, and the
      condition of his tenantry; but this eagerness had subsided, and the design
      had almost faded from his mind, whilst under the influence of Lady
      Dashfort's misrepresentations. A mistake, relative to some remittance from
      his banker in Dublin, obliged him to delay his journey a few days, and
      during that time Lord and Lady Oranmore showed him the neat cottages, the
      well-attended schools, in their neighbourhood. They showed him not only
      what could be done, but what had been done, by the influence of great
      proprietors residing on their own estates, and encouraging the people by
      judicious kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, he acknowledged the truth of this; but it did not come home to his
      feelings now as it would have done a little while ago. His views and plans
      were altered; he looked forward to the idea of marrying and settling in
      Ireland, and then everything in the country was interesting to him; but
      since he had forbidden himself to think of a union with Miss Nugent, his
      mind had lost its object and its spring; he was not sufficiently calm to
      think of the public good; his thoughts were absorbed by his private
      concern. He knew, and repeated to himself, that he ought to visit his own
      and his father's estates, and to see the condition of his tenantry; he
      desired to fulfil his duties, but they ceased to appear to him easy and
      pleasurable, for hope and love no longer brightened his prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he might see and hear more than he could as heir-apparent to the
      estate, he sent his servant to Dublin to wait for him there. He travelled
      INCOGNITO, wrapped himself in a shabby greatcoat, and took the name of
      Evans. He arrived at a village, or, as it was called, a town, which bore
      the name of Colambre. He was agreeably surprised by the air of neatness
      and finish in the houses and in the street, which had a nicely-swept paved
      footway. He slept at a small but excellent inn&#8212;excellent, perhaps,
      because it was small, and proportioned to the situation and business of
      the place. Good supper, good bed, good attendance; nothing out of repair;
      no things pressed into services for what they were never intended by
      nature or art; none of what are vulgarly called MAKE-SHIFTS. No
      chambermaid slipshod, or waiter smelling of whisky; but all tight and
      right, and everybody doing their own business, and doing it as if it was
      their everyday occupation, not as if it was done by particular desire, for
      first or last time this season. The landlord came in at supper to inquire
      whether anything was wanted. Lord Colambre took this opportunity of
      entering into conversation with him, and asked him to whom the town
      belonged, and who were the proprietors of the neighbouring estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The town belongs to an absentee lord&#8212;one Lord Clonbrony, who lives
      always beyond the seas, in London; and never seen the town since it was a
      town, to call a town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And does the land in the neighbourhood belong to this Lord Clonbrony?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does, sir; he's a great proprietor, but knows nothing of his property,
      nor of us. Never set foot among us, to my knowledge, since I was as high
      as the table. He might as well be a West India planter, and we negroes,
      for anything he knows to the contrary&#8212;has no more care, nor thought
      about us, than if he were in Jamaica, or the other world. Shame for him!&#8212;But
      there's too many to keep him in countenance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre asked him what wine he could have; and then inquired who
      managed the estate for this absentee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Burke, sir. And I don't know why God was so kind to give so good an
      agent to an absentee like Lord Clonbrony, except it was for the sake of
      us, who is under him, and knows the blessing, and is thankful for the
      same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very good cutlets,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am happy to hear it, sir. They have a right to be good, for Mrs. Burke
      sent her own cook to teach my wife to dress cutlets.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So the agent is a good agent, is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is, thanks be to Heaven! And that's what few can boast, especially
      when the landlord's living over the seas: we have the luck to have got a
      good agent over us, in Mr. Burke, who is a right bred gentleman; a snug
      little property of his own, honestly made; with the good will and good
      wishes, and respect of all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does he live in the neighbourhood?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just CONVANIENT [CONVENIENT: near.] At the end of the town; in the house
      on the hill, as you passed, sir; to the left, with the trees about it, all
      of his planting, finely grown too&#8212;for there's a blessing on all he
      does, and he has done a deal.&#8212;There's salad, sir, if you are partial
      to it. Very fine lettuce. Mrs. Burke sent us the plants herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excellent salad! So this Mr. Burke has done a great deal, has he? In what
      way!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In every way, sir&#8212;sure was not it he that had improved, and
      fostered, and made the town of Colambre?&#8212;no thanks to the
      proprietor, nor to the young man whose name it bears, neither!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you any porter, pray, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have, sir, as good, I hope, as you'd drink in London, for it's the
      same you get there, I understand, from Cork. And I have some of my own
      brewing, which, they say, you could not tell the difference between it and
      Cork quality&#8212;if you'd be pleased to try. Harry, the corkscrew.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter of his own brewing was pronounced to be extremely good; and the
      landlord observed it was Mr. Burke encouraged him to learn to brew, and
      lent him his own brewer for a time to teach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your Mr. Burke, I find, is APROPOS to porter, APROPOS to salad, APROPOS
      to cutlets, APROPOS to everything,' said Lord Colambre, smiling; 'he seems
      to be a NON-PAREIL of an agent. I suppose you are a great favourite of
      his, and you do what you please with him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, sir, I could not say that; Mr. Burke does not have favourites
      anyway; but according to my deserts, I trust, I stand well enough with
      him, for, in truth, he is a right good agent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre still pressed for particulars; he was an Englishman, and a
      stranger, he said, and did not exactly know what was meant in Ireland by a
      good agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, he is the man that will encourage the improving tenant; and show no
      favour or affection, but justice, which comes even to all, and does best
      for all at the long run; and, residing always in the country, like Mr.
      Burke, and understanding country business, and going about continually
      among the tenantry, he knows when to press for the rent, and when to leave
      the money to lay out upon the land; and, according as they would want it,
      can give a tenant a help or a check properly. Then no duty-work called
      for, no presents, nor GLOVE-MONEY, nor SEALING-MONEY even, taken or
      offered; no underhand hints about proposals, when land would be out of
      lease, but a considerable preference, if desArved, to the old tenant, and
      if not, a fair advertisement, and the best offer and tenant accepted; no
      screwing of the land to the highest penny, just to please the head
      landlord for the minute, and ruin him at the end, by the tenant's racking
      the land, and running off with the year's rent; nor no bargains to his own
      relations or friends did Mr. Burke ever give or grant, but all fair
      between landlord and tenant; and that's the thing that will last; and
      that's what I call the good agent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre poured out a glass of wine, and begged the innkeeper to
      drink the good agent's health, in which he was heartily pledged. 'I thank
      your honour;&#8212;Mr. Burke's health! and long may he live over and
      amongst us; he saved me from drink and ruin, when I was once inclined to
      it, and made a man of me and all my family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The particulars we cannot stay to detail: this grateful man, however, took
      pleasure in sounding the praises of his benefactor, and in raising him in
      the opinion of the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As you've time, and are curious about such things, sir, perhaps you'd
      walk up to the school that Mrs. Burke has for the poor children; and look
      at the market-house, and see how clean he takes a pride to keep the town;
      and any house in the town, from the priest to the parson's, that you'd go
      into, will give you the same character as I do of Mr. Burke: from the
      brogue to the boot, all speak the same of him, and can say no other. God
      for ever bless and keep him over us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon making further inquiries, everything the innkeeper had said was
      confirmed by different inhabitants of the village. Lord Colambre conversed
      with the shopkeepers, with the cottagers; and, without making any alarming
      inquiries, he obtained all the information he wanted. He went to the
      village school&#8212;a pretty, cheerful house, with a neat garden and a
      play-green; met Mrs. Burke; introduced himself to her as a traveller. The
      school was shown to him: it was just what it ought to be&#8212;neither too
      much nor too little had been attempted; there was neither too much
      interference nor too little attention. Nothing for exhibition; care to
      teach well, without any vain attempt to teach in a wonderfully short time.
      All that experience proves to be useful, in both Dr. Bell's and Mr.
      Lancaster's modes of teaching, Mrs. Burke had adopted; leaving it to
      'graceless zealots' to fight about the rest. That no attempts at
      proselytism had been made, and that no illiberal distinctions had been
      made in this school, Lord Colambre was convinced, in the best manner
      possible, by seeing the children of Protestants and Catholics sitting on
      the same benches, learning from the same books, and speaking to one
      another with the same cordial familiarity. Mrs. Burke was an unaffected,
      sensible woman, free from all party prejudices, and, without ostentation,
      desirous and capable of doing good. Lord Colambre was much pleased with
      her, and very glad that she invited him to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burke did not come in till late; for he had been detained portioning
      out some meadows, which were of great consequence to the inhabitants of
      the town. He brought home to dine with him the clergyman and the priest of
      the parish, both of whom he had taken successful pains to accommodate with
      the land which suited their respective convenience. The good terms on
      which they seemed to be with each other, and with him, appeared to Lord
      Colambre to do honour to Mr. Burke. All the favourable accounts his
      lordship had received of this gentleman were confirmed by what he saw and
      heard. After the clergyman and priest had taken leave, upon Lord
      Colambre's expressing some surprise, mixed with satisfaction, at seeing
      the harmony which subsisted between them, Mr. Burke assured him that this
      was the same in many parts of Ireland. He observed, that 'as the suspicion
      of ill-will never fails to produce it,' so he had often found, that taking
      it for granted that no ill-will exists has the most conciliating effect.
      He said, to please opposite parties, he used no arts; but he tried to make
      all his neighbours live comfortably together, by making them acquainted
      with each other's good qualities; by giving them opportunities of meeting
      sociably, and, from time to time, of doing each other little services and
      good offices. 'Fortunately, he had so much to do,' he said, 'that he had
      no time for controversy. He was a plain man, made it a rule not to meddle
      with speculative points, and to avoid all irritating discussions; he was
      not to rule the country, but to live in it, and make others live as
      happily as he could.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having nothing to conceal in his character, opinions, or circumstances,
      Mr. Burke was perfectly open and unreserved in his manner and
      conversation; freely answered all the traveller's inquiries, and took
      pains to show him everything he desired to see. Lord Colambre said he had
      thoughts of settling in Ireland; and declared, with truth, that he had not
      seen any part of the country he should like better to live in than this
      neighbourhood. He went over most of the estate with Mr. Burke, and had
      ample opportunities of convincing himself that this gentleman was indeed,
      as the innkeeper had described him, 'a right good gentleman, and a right
      good agent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid Mr. Burke some just compliments on the state of the tenantry, and
      the neat and flourishing appearance of the town of Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What pleasure it will give the proprietor when he sees all you have
      done!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, sir, don't speak of it!&#8212;that breaks my heart, he never has
      shown the least interest in anything I have done; he is quite dissatisfied
      with me, because I have not ruined his tenantry, by forcing them to pay
      more than the land is worth; because I have not squeezed money from them
      by fining down rents; and&#8212;but all this, as an Englishman, sir, must
      be unintelligible to you. The end of the matter is, that, attached as I am
      to this place and the people about me, and, as I hope, the tenantry are to
      me&#8212;I fear I shall be obliged to give up the agency.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give up the agency! How so?&#8212;you must not,' cried Lord Colambre,
      and, for the moment, he forgot himself; but Mr. Burke took this only for
      an expression of good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must, I am afraid,' continued he. 'My employer, Lord Clonbrony, is
      displeased with me&#8212;continual calls for money come upon me from
      England, and complaints of my slow remittances.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps Lord Clonbrony is in embarrassed circumstances said Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never speak of my employer's affairs, sir,' replied Mr. Burke; now for
      the first time assuming an air of reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon, sir&#8212;I seem to have asked an indiscreet question.'
      Mrs. Burke was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lest my reserve should give you a false impression, I will add, sir,'
      resumed Mr. Burke, 'that I really am not acquainted with the state of his
      lordship's affairs in general. I know only what belongs to the estate
      under my own management. The principal part of his lordship's property,
      the Clonbrony estate, is under another agent, Mr. Garraghty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Garraghty!' repeated Lord Colambre; 'what sort of a person is he? But I
      may take it for granted, that it cannot fall to the lot of one and the
      same absentee to have two such agents as Mr. Burke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burke bowed, and seemed pleased by the compliment, which he knew he
      deserved&#8212;but not a word did he say of Mr. Garraghty; and Lord
      Colambre, afraid of betraying himself by some other indiscreet question,
      changed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very night the post brought a letter to Mr. Burke, from Lord
      Clonbrony, which Mr. Burke gave to his wife as soon as he had read it,
      saying&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'See the reward of all my services!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Burke glanced her eye over the letter, and, being extremely fond of
      her husband, and sensible of his deserving far different treatment, burst
      into indignant exclamations&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'See the reward of all your services, indeed!&#8212;What an unreasonable,
      ungrateful man!&#8212;So, this is the thanks for all you have done for
      Lord Clonbrony!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He does not know what I have done, my dear. He never has seen what I have
      done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More shame for him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He never, I suppose, looks over his accounts, or understands them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More shame for him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He listens to foolish reports, or misrepresentations, perhaps. He is at a
      distance, and cannot find out the truth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More shame for him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take it quietly, my dear; we have the comfort of a good conscience. The
      agency may be taken from me by this lord; but the sense of having done my
      duty, no lord or man upon earth can give or take away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a letter!' said Mrs. Burke, taking it up again. 'Not even the
      civility to write with his own hand!&#8212;only his signature to the
      scrawl&#8212;looks as if it was written by a drunken man, does not it, Mr.
      Evans?' said she, showing the letter to Lord Colambre, who immediately
      recognised the writing of Sir Terence O'Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does not look like the hand of a gentleman, indeed,' said Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has Lord Clonbrony's own signature, let it be what it will,' said Mr.
      Burke, looking closely at it; 'Lord Clonbrony's own writing the signature
      is, I am clear of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony's son was clear of it also; but he took care not to give
      any opinion on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, pray, read it, sir, read it,' said Mrs. Burke, pleased by his tone of
      indignation; 'read it, pray; a gentleman may write a bad hand, but no
      GENTLEMAN could write such a letter as that to Mr. Burke&#8212;pray read
      it, sir; you who have seen something of what Mr. Burke has done for the
      town of Colambre, and what he has made of the tenantry and the estate of
      Lord Clonbrony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre read, and was convinced that his father had never written or
      read the letter, but had signed it, trusting to Sir Terence O'Fay's having
      expressed his sentiments properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR, As I have no further occasion for your services, you will take
      notice, that I hereby request you will forthwith hand over, on or before
      the 1st of November next, your accounts, with the balance due of the
      HANGING-GALE (which, I understand, is more than ought to be at this
      season) to Nicholas O'Garraghty, Esq., College Green, Dublin, who in
      future will act as agent, and shall get, by post, immediately, a power of
      attorney for the same, entitling him to receive and manage the Colambre as
      well as the Clonbrony estate, for, Sir, your obedient humble servant,
      CLONBRONY.
    </p>
    <p>
      'GROSVENOR SQUARE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though misrepresentation, caprice, or interest, might have induced Lord
      Clonbrony to desire to change his agent, yet Lord Colambre knew that his
      father never could have announced his wishes in such a style; and, as he
      returned the letter to Mrs. Burke, he repeated, he was convinced that it
      was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter; that it
      must have been written by some inferior person; and that his lordship had
      signed it without reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, I'm sorry you showed that letter to Mr. Evans,' said Mr. Burke;
      'I don't like to expose Lord Clonbrony; he is a well-meaning gentleman,
      misled by ignorant or designing people; at all events, it is not for us to
      expose him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has exposed himself,' said Mrs. Burke; 'and the world should know it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was very kind to me when I was a young man,' said Mr. Burke; 'we must
      not forget that now, because we are angry, my love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, no, my love, to be sure we should not; but who could have
      recollected it just at this minute but yourself?&#8212;And now, sir,'
      turning to Lord Colambre, 'you see what kind of a man this is: now is it
      not difficult for me to bear patiently to see him ill-treated?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not only difficult, but impossible, I should think, madam,' said Lord
      Colambre; 'I know, even I, who am a stranger, cannot help feeling for both
      of you, as you must see I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And half the world, who don't know him,' continued Mrs. Burke, 'when they
      hear that Lord Clonbrony's agency is taken from him, will think, perhaps,
      that he is to blame.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, madam,' said Lord Colambre; 'that you need not fear; Mr. Burke may
      safely trust to his character; from what I have within these two days seen
      and heard, I am convinced that such is the respect he has deserved and
      acquired, that no blame can touch him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir, I thank you,' said Mrs. Burke, the tears coming into her eyes; 'you
      can judge&#8212;you do him justice; but there are so many who don't know
      him, and who will decide without knowing any of the facts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That, my dear, happens about everything to everybody,' said Mr. Burke;
      'but we must have patience; time sets all judgments right, sooner or
      later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the sooner the better,' said Mrs. Burke. 'Mr. Evans, I hope you will
      be so kind, if ever you hear this business talked of&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Evans lives in Wales, my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But he is travelling through Ireland, my dear, and he said he should
      return to Dublin, and, you know, there he certainly will hear it talked
      of; and I hope he will do me the favour to state what he has seen and
      knows to be the truth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be assured that I will do Mr. Burke justice&#8212;as far as it is in my
      power,' said Lord Colambre, restraining himself much, that he might not
      say more than became his assumed character. He took leave of this worthy
      family that night, and, early the next morning, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' thought he, as he drove away from this well-regulated and
      flourishing place, 'how happy I might be, settled here with such a wife as&#8212;her
      of whom I must think no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his way to Clonbrony, his father's other estate, which was at a
      considerable distance from Colambre; he was resolved to know what kind of
      agent Mr. Nicholas Garraghty might be, who was to supersede Mr. Burke, and
      by power of attorney to be immediately entitled to receive and manage the
      Colambre as well as the Clonbrony estate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Towards the evening of the second day's journey, the driver of Lord
      Colambre's hackney chaise stopped, and jumping off the wooden bar, on
      which he had been seated, exclaimed&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We're come to the bad step, now. The bad road's beginning upon us, please
      your honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bad road! that is very uncommon in this country. I never saw such fine
      roads as you have in Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true; and God bless your honour, that's sensible of that same, for
      it's not what all the foreign quality I drive have the manners to notice.
      God bless your honour! I heard you're a Welshman, but whether or no, I am
      sure you are a gentleman, anyway, Welsh or other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the shabby greatcoat, the shrewd postillion perceived, by
      our hero's language, that he was a gentleman. After much dragging at the
      horses' heads, and pushing and lifting, the carriage was got over what the
      postillion said was the worst part of THE BAD STEP; but as the road 'was
      not yet to say good,' he continued walking beside the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's only bad just hereabouts, and that by accident,' said he, 'on
      account of there being no jantleman resident in it, nor near; but only a
      bit of an under-agent, a great little rogue, who gets his own turn out of
      the roads, and of everything else in life. I, Larry Brady, that am telling
      your honour, have a good right to know, for myself, and my father, and my
      brother. Pat Brady, the wheelwright, had once a farm under him; but was
      ruined, horse and foot, all along with him, and cast out, and my brother
      forced to fly the country, and is now working in some coachmaker's yard,
      in London; banished he is!&#8212;and here am I, forced to be what I am&#8212;and
      now that I'm reduced to drive a hack, the agent's a curse to me still,
      with these bad roads, killing my horses and wheels and a shame to the
      country, which I think more of&#8212;Bad luck to him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know your brother; he lives with Mr. Mordicai, in Long Acre, in
      London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, God bless you for that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They came at this time within view of a range of about four-and-twenty men
      and boys, sitting astride on four-and-twenty heaps of broken stones, on
      each side of the road; they were all armed with hammers, with which they
      began to pound with great diligence and noise as soon as they saw the
      carriage. The chaise passed between these batteries, the stones flying on
      all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, Jem?&#8212;How are you, Phil?' said Larry. 'But hold your
      hand, can't ye, while I stop and get the stones out of the horses' FEET.
      So you're making up the rent, are you, for St. Dennis?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whoosh!' said one of the pounders, coming close to the postillion, and
      pointing his thumb back towards the chaise. 'Who have you in it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you need not scruple, he's a very honest man; he's only a man from
      North Wales, one Mr. Evans, an innocent jantleman, that's sent over to
      travel up and down the country, to find is there any copper mines in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you know, Larry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I know very well, from one that was tould, and I SEEN him tax the
      man of the King's Head, with a copper half-crown, at first sight, which
      was only lead to look at, you'd think, to them that was not skilful in
      copper. So lend me a knife, till I cut a linch-pin out of the hedge, for
      this one won't go far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Larry was making the linch-pin, all scruple being removed, his
      question about St. Dennis and the rent was answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, it's the rint, sure enough, we're pounding out for him; for he sent
      the driver round last-night-was-eight days, to warn us old Nick would be
      down a'-Monday, to take a sweep among us; and there's only six clear days,
      Saturday night, before the assizes, sure; so we must see and get it
      finished anyway, to clear the presentment again' the swearing day, for he
      and Paddy Hart is the overseers themselves, and Paddy is to swear to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'St. Dennis, is it? Then you've one great comfort and security&#8212;that
      he won't be PARTICULAR about the swearing; for since ever he had his head
      on his shoulders, an oath never stuck in St. Dennis's throat, more than in
      his own brother, old Nick's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His head upon his shoulders!' repeated Lord Colambre. 'Pray, did you ever
      hear that St. Dennis's head was off his shoulders?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It never was, plase your honour, to my knowledge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you never, among your saints, hear of St. Dennis carrying his head in
      his hand?' said Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The RAEL saint!' said the postillion, suddenly changing his tone, and
      looking shocked. 'Oh, don't be talking that way of the saints, plase your
      honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then of what St, Dennis were you talking just now?&#8212;Whom do you mean
      by St. Dennis, and whom do you call old Nick?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old Nick,' answered the postillion, coming close to the side of the
      carriage, and whispering&#8212;'Old Nick, plase your honour, is our
      nickname for one Nicholas Garraghty, Esq., of College Green, Dublin, and
      St. Dennis is his brother Dennis, who is old Nick's brother in all things,
      and would fain be a saint, only he is a sinner. He lives just by here, in
      the country, under-agent to Lord Clonbrony, as old Nick is upper-agent&#8212;it's
      only a joke among the people, that are not fond of them at all. Lord
      Clonbrony himself is a very good jantleman, if he was not an absentee,
      resident in London, leaving us and everything to the likes of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre listened with all possible composure and attention; but the
      postillion having now made his linch-pin of wood, and FIXED HIMSELF; he
      mounted his bar, and drove on, saying to Lord Colambre, as he looked at
      the road-makers&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor CRATURES! They couldn't keep their cattle out of pound, or
      themselves out of jail, but by making this road.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is road-making, then, a very profitable business?&#8212;Have road-makers
      higher wages than other men in this part of the country?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is, and it is not&#8212;they have, and they have not&#8212;plase your
      honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't understand you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, becaase you're an Englishman&#8212;that is, a Welshman&#8212;I beg
      your honour's pardon. But I'll tell you how that is, and I'll go slow over
      these broken stones for I can't go fast: it is where there's no jantleman
      over these under-agents, as here, they do as they plase; and when they
      have set the land they get rasonable from the head landlords, to poor
      cratures at a rack-rent, that they can't live and pay the rent, they say&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who says?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Them under-agents, that have no conscience at all. Not all&#8212;but
      SOME, like Dennis, says, says he, "I'll get you a road to make up the
      rent:" that is, plase your honour, the agent gets them a presentment for
      so many perches of road from the grand jury, at twice the price that would
      make the road. And tenants are, by this means, as they take the road by
      contract, at the price given by the county, able to pay all they get by
      the job, over and above potatoes and salt, back again to the agent, for
      the arrear on the land. Do I make your honour SENSIBLE?' [Do I make you
      understand?]
    </p>
    <p>
      'You make me much more sensible than I ever was before,' said Lord
      Colambre; 'but is not this cheating the county?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, and suppose,' replied Larry, 'is not it all for my good, and yours
      too, plase your honour?' said Larry, looking very shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My good!' said Lord Colambre, startled. 'What have I to do with it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Haven't you to do with the roads as well as me, when you're travelling
      upon them, plase your honour? And sure, they'd never be got made at all,
      if they weren't made this ways; and it's the best way in the wide world,
      and the finest roads we have. And when the RAEL jantlemen's resident in
      the country, there's no jobbing can be, because they're then the leading
      men on the grand jury; and these journeymen jantlemen are then kept in
      order, and all's right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was much surprised at Larry's knowledge of the manner in
      which county business is managed, as well as by his shrewd good sense: he
      did not know that this is not uncommon in his rank of life in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Larry was speaking, Lord Colambre was looking from side to side at
      the desolation of the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So this is Lord Clonbrony's estate, is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, all you see, and as far and farther than you can see. My Lord
      Clonbrony wrote, and ordered plantations here, time back; and enough was
      paid to labourers for ditching and planting. And, what next?&#8212;Why,
      what did the under-agent do, but let the goats in through gaps, left o'
      purpose, to bark the trees, and then the trees was all banished. And next,
      the cattle was let in trespassing, and winked at, till the land was all
      poached; and then the land was waste, and cried down; and St. Dennis wrote
      up to Dublin to old Nick, and he over to the landlord, how none would take
      it, or bid anything at all for it; so then it fell to him a cheap bargain.
      Oh, the tricks of them! who knows 'em, if I don't?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, Lord Colambre's attention was roused again, by seeing a man
      running, as if for his life, across a bog, near the roadside; he leaped
      over the ditch, and was upon the road in an instant. He seemed startled at
      first, at the sight of the carriage; but, looking at the postillion, Larry
      nodded, and he smiled and said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'All's safe!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pray, my good friend, may I ask what that is you have on your shoulder?'
      said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLASE your honour, it is only a private still, which I've just caught out
      yonder in the bog; and I'm carrying it in with all speed to the gauger, to
      make a discovery, that the JANTLEMAN may benefit by the reward; I expect
      he'll make me a compliment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get up behind, and I'll give you a lift,' said the postillion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you kindly&#8212;but better my legs!' said the man; and turning
      down a lane, off he ran again as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Expect he'll make me a compliment,' repeated Lord Colambre, 'to make a
      discovery!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, plase your honour; for the law is,' said Larry, 'that, if an unlawful
      still, that is, a still without license for whisky, is found, half the
      benefit of the fine that's put upon the parish goes to him that made the
      discovery; that's what that man is after, for he's an informer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should not have thought, from what I see of you,' said Lord Colambre,
      smiling, 'that you, Larry, would have offered an informer a lift.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, plase your honour!' said Larry, smiling archly, 'would not I give the
      laws a lift, when in my power?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he uttered these words, and scarcely was the informer out of
      sight, when across the same bog, and over the ditch, came another man, a
      half kind of gentleman, with a red silk handkerchief about his neck, and a
      silver-handled whip in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you see any man pass the road, friend?' said he to the postillion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! who would I see? or why would I tell?' replied Larry, in a sulky
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Came, come, be smart!' said the man with the silver whip, offering to put
      half a crown into the postillion's hand; 'point me which way he took.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll have none a' your silver! don't touch me with it!' said Larry. 'But,
      if you'll take my advice, you'll strike across back, and follow the
      fields, out to Killogenesawee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The exciseman set out again immediately, in an opposite direction to that
      which the man who carried the still had taken. Lord Colambre now perceived
      that the pretended informer had been running off to conceal a still of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The gauger, plase your honour,' said Larry, looking back at Lord
      Colambre; 'the gauger is a STILL-HUNTING!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you put him on a wrong scent!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, I told him no lie; I only said, "If you'll take my advice." And why
      was he such a fool as to take my advice, when I wouldn't take his fee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So this is the way, Larry, you give a lift to the laws!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If the laws would give a lift to me, plase your honour, maybe I'd do as
      much by them. But it's only these revenue laws I mean; for I never, to my
      knowledge, broke another commandment; but it's what no honest poor man
      among his neighbours would scruple to take&#8212;a glass of POTSHEEN.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A glass of what, in the name of Heaven?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      POTSHEEN, plase your honour;&#8212;becaase it's the little whisky that's
      made in the private still or pot; and SHEEN, becaase it's a fond word for
      whatsoever we'd like, and for what we have little of, and would make much
      of: after taking the glass of it, no man could go and inform to ruin the
      CRATURES, for they all shelter on that estate under favour of them that go
      shares, and make rent of 'em&#8212;but I'd never inform again' 'em. And,
      after all, if the truth was known, and my Lord Clonbrony should be
      informed against, and presented, for it's his neglect is the bottom of the
      nuisance&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I find all the blame is thrown upon this poor Lord Clonbrony,' said Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Becaase he is absent,' said Larry. 'It would not be so was he PRISINT.
      But your honour was talking to me about the laws. Your honour's a stranger
      in this country, and astray about them things. Sure, why would I mind the
      laws about whisky, more than the quality, or the judge on the bench?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why! was not I PRISINT in the court-house myself, when the JIDGE on the
      bench judging a still, and across the court came in one with a sly jug of
      POTSHEEN for the JIDGE himself, who prefarred it, when the right thing, to
      claret; and when I SEEN that, by the laws! a man might talk himself dumb
      to me after again' potsheen, or in favour of the revenue, or
      revenue-officers. And there they may go on, with their gaugers, and their
      surveyors, and their supervisors, and their WATCHING-OFFICERS, and their
      coursing-officers, setting 'em one after another, or one over the head of
      another, or what way they will&#8212;we can baffle and laugh at 'em.
      Didn't I know, next door to our inn, last year, ten WATCHING-OFFICERS set
      upon one distiller, and he was too cunning for them; and it will always be
      so, while ever the people think it no sin. No, till then, not all their
      dockets and permits signify a rush, or a turf. And the gauging rod even!
      who fears it? They may spare that rod, for it will never mend the child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      How much longer Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws would have
      continued, had not his ideas been interrupted, we cannot guess; but he saw
      he was coming to a town, and he gathered up the reins, and plied the whip,
      ambitious to make a figure in the eyes of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      This TOWN consisted of one row of miserable huts, sunk beneath the side of
      the road, the mud walls crooked in every direction; some of them opening
      in wide cracks, or zigzag fissures, from top to bottom, as if there had
      just been an earthquake&#8212;all the roofs sunk in various places&#8212;thatch
      off, or overgrown with grass&#8212;no chimneys, the smoke making its way
      through a hole in the roof, or rising in clouds from the top of the open
      door&#8212;dunghills before the doors, and green standing puddles&#8212;squalid
      children, with scarcely rags to cover them, gazing at the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nugent's town,' said the postillion, 'once a snug place, when my Lady
      Clonbrony was at home to whitewash it, and the like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove by, some men and women put their heads through the smoke out
      of the cabins; pale women with long, black, or yellow locks&#8212;men with
      countenances and figures bereft of hope and energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wretched, wretched people!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then it's not their fault neither,' said Larry; 'for my own uncle's one
      of them, and as thriving and hard a working man as could be in all
      Ireland, he was, AFORE he was tramped under foot, and his heart broke. I
      was at his funeral, this time last year; and for it, may the agent's own
      heart, if he has any, burn&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre interrupted this denunciation by touching Larry's shoulder,
      and asking some question, which, as Larry did not distinctly comprehend,
      he pulled up the reins, and the various noises of the vehicle stopped
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not hear well, plase your honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are those people?' pointing to a man and woman, curious figures, who
      had come out of a cabin, the door of which the woman, who came out last,
      locked, and carefully hiding the key in the thatch, turned her back upon
      the man, and they walked away in different directions: the woman bending
      under a huge bundle on her back, covered by a yellow petticoat turned over
      her shoulders; from the top of this bundle the head of an infant appeared;
      a little boy, almost naked, followed her with a kettle, and two girls, one
      of whom could but just walk, held her hand and clung to her ragged
      petticoat; forming, altogether, a complete group of beggars. The woman
      stopped, and looked back after the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was a Spanish-looking figure, with gray hair; a wallet hung at the
      end of a stick over one shoulder, a reaping-hook in the other hand; he
      walked off stoutly, without ever casting a look behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A kind harvest to you, John Dolan,' cried the postillion, 'and success to
      ye, Winny, with the quality. There's a luck-penny for the child to begin
      with,' added he, throwing the child a penny. 'Your honour, they're only
      poor CRATURES going up the country to beg, while the man goes over to reap
      the harvest in England. Nor this would not be, neither, if the lord was in
      it to give 'em EMPLOY. That man, now, was a good and a willing SLAVE in
      his day: I mind him working with myself in the shrubberies at Clonbrony
      Castle, when I was a boy&#8212;but I'll not be detaining your honour, now
      the road's better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The postillion drove on at a good rate for some time, till he came to a
      piece of the road freshly covered with broken stones, where he was obliged
      again to go slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They overtook a string of cars, on which were piled up high, beds, tables,
      chairs, trunks, boxes, bandboxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, Finnucan? you've fine loading there&#8212;from Dublin, are
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From Bray.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what news?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'GREAT news and bad, for old Nick, or some belonging to him, thanks be to
      Heaven! for myself hates him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's happened him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His sister's husband that's failed, the great grocer that was, the man
      that had the wife that OW'D [Owned] the fine house near Bray, that they
      got that time the Parliament FLITTED, and that I seen in her carriage
      flaming&#8212;well, it's all out; they're all DONE UP.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tut! is that all? then they'll thrive, and set up again grander than
      ever, I'll engage; have not they old Nick for an attorney at their back? a
      good warrant!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, trust him for that! he won't go security nor pay a farthing for his
      SHISTER, nor wouldn't was she his father; I heard him telling her so,
      which I could not have done in his place at that time, and she crying as
      if her heart would break, and I standing by in the parlour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The NEGER! [NEGER, quasi negro; meo periculo, NIGGARD] And did he speak
      that way, and you by?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay did he; and said, "Mrs. Raffarty," says he, "it's all your own fault;
      you're an extravagant fool, and ever was, and I wash my hands of you;"
      that was the word he spoke; and she answered, and said, "And mayn't I send
      the beds and blankets," said she, "and what I can, by the cars, out of the
      way of the creditors, to Clonbrony Castle; and won't you let me hide there
      from the shame, till the bustle's over?"&#8212;"You may do that," says he,
      "for what I care; but remember," says he, "that I've the first claim to
      them goods;" and that's all he would grant. So they are coming down all o'
      Monday&#8212;them are her bandboxes and all to settle it; and faith it was
      a pity of her! to hear her sobbing, and to see her own brother speak and
      look so hard! and she a lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure she's not a lady born, no more than himself,' said Larry; 'but
      that's no excuse for him. His heart's as hard as that stone,' said Larry;
      'and my own people knew that long ago, and now his own know it; and what
      right have we to complain, since he's as bad to his own flesh and blood as
      to us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      With this consolation, and with a 'God speed you,' given to the carman,
      Larry was driving off; but the carman called to him, and pointed to a
      house, at the corner of which, on a high pole, was swinging an iron sign
      of three horse-shoes, set in a crooked frame, and at the window hung an
      empty bottle, proclaiming whisky within.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't care if I do,' said Larry; 'for I've no other comfort left
      me in life now. I beg your honour's pardon, sir, for a minute,' added he,
      throwing the reins into the carriage to Lord Colambre, as he leaped down.
      All remonstrance and power of lungs to reclaim him vain! He darted into
      the whisky-house with the carman&#8212;reappeared before Lord Colambre
      could accomplish getting out, remounted his seat, and, taking the reins,
      'I thank your honour,' said he; 'and I'll bring you into Clonbrony before
      it's pitch-dark yet, though it's nightfall, and that's four good miles,
      but "a spur in the head is worth two in the heel."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry, to demonstrate the truth of his favourite axiom, drove off at such
      a furious rate over great stones left in the middle of the road by carmen,
      who had been driving in the gudgeons of their axle-trees to hinder them
      from lacing, [Opening; perhaps from LACHER, to loosen.] that Lord Colambre
      thought life and limb in imminent danger; and feeling that at all events
      the jolting and bumping was past endurance, he had recourse to Larry's
      shoulder, and shook and pulled, and called to him to go slower, but in
      vain; at last the wheel struck full against a heap of stones at a turn of
      the road, the wooden linch-pin came off, and the chaise was overset: Lord
      Colambre was a little bruised, but glad to escape without fractured bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your honour's pardon,' said Larry, completely sobered; 'I'm as glad
      as the best pair of boots ever I see, to see your honour nothing the worse
      for it. It was the linch-pin, and them barrows of loose stones, that ought
      to be fined anyway, if there was any justice in the country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The pole is broke; how are we to get on?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Murder! murder!&#8212;and no smith nearer than Clonbrony; nor rope even.
      It's a folly to talk, we can't get to Clonbrony, nor stir a step backward
      or forward the night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, then, do you mean to leave me all night in the middle of the road?'
      cried Lord Colambre, quite exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it me! please your honour? I would not use any jantleman so ill,
      BARRING I could do no other,' replied the postillion, coolly; then,
      leaping across the ditch, or, as he called it, the GRIPE of the ditch, he
      scrambled up, and while he was scrambling, said, 'If your honour will lend
      me your hand till I pull you up the back of the ditch, the horses will
      stand while we go. I'll find you as pretty a lodging for the night, with a
      widow of a brother of my shister's husband that was, as ever you slept in
      your life; for old Nick or St. Dennis has not found 'em out yet; and your
      honour will be, no compare, snugger than the inn at Clonbrony, which has
      no roof, the devil a stick. But where will I get your honour's hand; for
      it's coming on so dark, I can't see rightly. There, you're up now safe.
      Yonder candle's the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go and ask whether they can give us a night's lodging.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it ASK? when I see the light!&#8212;Sure they'd be proud to give the
      traveller all the beds in the house, let alone one. Take care of the
      potato furrows, that's all, and follow me straight. I'll go on to meet the
      dog, who knows me and might be strange to your honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kindly welcome,' were the first words Lord Colambre heard when he
      approached the cottage; and 'kindly welcome' was in the sound of the voice
      and in the countenance of the old woman who came out, shading her
      rush-candle from the wind, and holding it so as to light the path. When he
      entered the cottage, he saw a cheerful fire and a neat pretty young woman
      making it blaze: she curtsied, put her spinning-wheel out of the way, set
      a stool by the fire for the stranger, and repeating, in a very low tone of
      voice, 'Kindly welcome,' retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put down some eggs, dear, there's plenty in the bowl,' said the old
      woman, calling to her; 'I'll do the bacon. Was not we lucky to be up&#8212;The
      boy's gone to bed, but waken him,' said she, turning to the postillion;
      'and he'll help you with the chay, and put your horses in the bier for the
      night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No; Larry chose to go on to Clonbrony with the horses, that he might get
      the chaise mended betimes for his honour. The table was set; clean
      trenchers, hot potatoes, milk, eggs, bacon, and 'kindly welcome to all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Set the salt, dear; and the butter, love; where's your head, Grace,
      dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace!' repeated Lord Colambre, looking up; and, to apologise for his
      involuntary exclamation, he added, 'Is Grace a common name in Ireland?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't say, plase your honour, but it was give her by Lady Clonbrony,
      from a niece of her own that was her foster-sister, God bless her! and a
      very kind lady she was to us and to all when she was living in it; but
      those times are gone past,' said the old woman, with a sigh. The young
      woman sighed too; and, sitting down by the fire, began to count the
      notches in a little bit of stick, which she held in her hand; and, after
      she had counted them, sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't be sighing, Grace, now,' said the old woman; 'sighs is bad
      sauce for the traveller's supper; and we won't be troubling him with
      more,' added she, turning to Lord Colambre with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is your egg done to your liking?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfectly, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I wish it was a chicken for your sake, which it should have been,
      and roast too, had we time. I wish I could see you eat another egg.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No more, thank you, my good lady; I never ate a better supper, nor
      received a more hospitable welcome.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, the welcome is all we have to offer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I ask what that is?' said Lord Colambre, looking at the notched
      stick, which the young woman held in her hand, and on which her eyes were
      still fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a TALLY, plase your honour. Oh, you're a foreigner;&#8212;it's the
      way the labourers do keep the account of the day's work with the overseer,
      the bailiff; a notch for every day the bailiff makes on his stick, and the
      labourer the like on his stick, to tally; and when we come to make up the
      account, it's by the notches we go. And there's been a mistake, and is a
      dispute here between our boy and the overseer; and she was counting the
      boy's tally, that's in bed, tired, for in troth he's overworked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you want anything more from me, mother?' said the girl, rising and
      turning her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, child; get away, for your heart's full.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is the boy her brother?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; he's her bachelor,' said the old woman, lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her bachelor?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is, her sweetheart: for she is not my daughter, though you heard her
      call me mother. The boy's my son; but I am afeard they must give it up;
      for they're too poor, and the times is hard, and the agent's harder than
      the times; there's two of them, the under and the upper; and they grind
      the substance of one between them, and then blow one away like chaff: but
      we'll not be talking of that to spoil your honour's night's rest. The
      room's ready, and here's the rushlight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed him into a very small but neat room. 'What a
      comfortable-looking bed!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, these red check curtains,' said she, letting them down; 'these have
      lasted well; they were give me by a good friend, now far away, over the
      seas&#8212;my Lady Clonbrony; and made by the prettiest hands ever you
      see, her niece's, Miss Grace Nugent's, and she a little child that time;
      sweet love! all gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman wiped a tear from her eye, and Lord Colambre did what he
      could to appear indifferent. She set down the candle, and left the room;
      Lord Colambre went to bed, but he lay awake, 'revolving sweet and bitter
      thoughts.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The kettle was on the fire, tea-things set, everything prepared for her
      guest by the hospitable hostess, who, thinking the gentleman would take
      tea to his breakfast, had sent off a GOSSOON by the FIRST LIGHT to
      Clonbrony, for an ounce of tea, a QUARTER OF SUGAR, and a loaf of white
      bread; and there was on the little table good cream, milk, butter, eggs&#8212;all
      the promise of an excellent breakfast. It was a FRESH morning, and there
      was a pleasant fire on the hearth, neatly swept up. The old woman was
      sitting in her chimney corner, behind a little skreen of whitewashed wall,
      built out into the room, for the purpose of keeping those who sat at the
      fire from the BLAST OF THE DOOR. There was a loophole in this wall, to let
      the light in, just at the height of a person's head, who was sitting near
      the chimney. The rays of the morning sun now came through it, shining
      across the face of the old woman, as she sat knitting; Lord Colambre
      thought he had seldom seen a more agreeable countenance, intelligent eyes,
      benevolent smile, a natural expression of cheerfulness, subdued by age and
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A good-morrow to you kindly, sir, and I hope you got the night well?&#8212;A
      fine day for us this Sunday morning; my Grace is gone to early prayers, so
      your honour will be content with an old woman to make your breakfast. Oh,
      let me put in plenty, or it will never be good; and if your honour takes
      stir-about, an old hand will engage to make that to your liking, anyway;
      for, by great happiness, we have what will just answer for you of the
      nicest meal the miller made my Grace a compliment of, last time she went
      to the mill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre observed, that this miller had good taste; and his lordship
      paid some compliment to Grace's beauty, which the old woman received with
      a smile, but turned off the conversation. 'Then,' said she, looking out of
      the window, 'is not that there a nice little garden the boy dug for her
      and me, at his breakfast and dinner hours? Ah! he's a good boy, and a good
      warrant to work; and the good son DESARVES the good wife, and it's he that
      will make the good husband; and with my goodwill he, and no other, shall
      get her, and with her goodwill the same; and I bid 'em keep up their
      heart, and hope the best, for there's no use in fearing the worst till it
      comes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre wished very much to know the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you would not think a stranger impertinent for asking,' said he, 'and
      if it would not be painful to you to explain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, impertinent, your honour! it's very kind&#8212;and, sure, none's a
      stranger to one's heart, that feels for one. And for myself, I can talk of
      my troubles without thinking of them. So, I'll tell you all&#8212;if the
      worst comes to the worst&#8212;all that is, is, that we must quit, and
      give up this little snug place, and house, and farm, and all, to the agent&#8212;which
      would be hard on us, and me a widow, when my husband did all that is done
      to the land; and if your honour was a judge, you could see, if you stepped
      out, there has been a deal done, and built the house, and all&#8212;but it
      plased Heaven to take him. Well, he was too good for this world, and I'm
      satisfied&#8212;I'm not saying a word again' that&#8212;I trust we shall
      meet in heaven, and be happy, surely. And, meantime, here's my boy, that
      will make me as happy as ever widow was on earth&#8212;if the agent will
      let him. And I can't think the agent, though they that know him best call
      him old Nick, would be so wicked to take from us that which he never gave
      us. The good lord himself granted us the LASE; the life's dropped, and the
      years is out; but we had a promise of renewal in writing from the
      landlord. God bless him! if he was not away, he'd be a good gentleman, and
      we'd be happy and safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But if you have a promise in writing of a renewal, surely you are safe,
      whether your landlord is absent or present?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, no I that makes a great DIFFER, when there's no eye or hand over the
      agent. I would not wish to speak or think ill of him or any man; but was
      he an angel, he could not know to do the tenantry justice, the way he is
      living always in Dublin, and coming down to the country only the receiving
      days, to make a sweep among us, and gather up the rents in a hurry, and he
      in such haste back to town&#8212;can just stay to count over our money,
      and give the receipts. Happy for us, if we get that same!&#8212;but can't
      expect he should have time to see or hear us, or mind our improvements,
      any more than listen to our complaints! Oh, there's great excuse for the
      gentleman, if that was any comfort for us,' added she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, if he does not live amongst you himself, has not he some
      under-agent, who lives in the country?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he should know your concerns: does he mind them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He should know&#8212;he should know better; but as to minding our
      concerns, your honour knows,' continued she, smiling again, 'every one in
      this world must mind their own concerns; and it would be a good world, if
      it was even so. There's a great deal in all things, that don't appear at
      first sight. Mr. Dennis wanted Grace for a wife for his bailiff; but she
      would not have him; and Mr. Dennis was very sweet to her himself&#8212;but
      Grace is rather high with him as proper, and he has a grudge AGAIN' us
      ever since. Yet, indeed, there,' added she, after another pause, 'as you
      say, I think we are safe; for we have that memorandum in writing, with a
      pencil, given under his own hand, on the back of the LASE, to me, by the
      same token when my good lord had his foot on the step of the coach, going
      away; and I'll never forget the smile of her that got that good turn done
      for me, Miss Grace. And just when she was going to England and London,
      and, young as she was, to have the thought to stop and turn to the likes
      of me! Oh, then, if you could see her, and know her, as I did! THAT was
      the comforting angel upon earth&#8212;look and voice, and heart and all!
      Oh, that she was here present, this minute!&#8212;But did you scald
      yourself?' said the widow to Lord Colambre. 'Sure you must have scalded
      yourself; for you poured the kettle straight over your hand, and it
      boiling!&#8212;O DEEAR! to think of so young a gentleman's hand shaking so
      like my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, to prevent her pursuing her observations from the hand to the
      face, which might have betrayed more than Lord Colambre wished she should
      know, her own Grace came in at this instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There it's for you, safe, mother dear&#8212;the LASE!' said Grace,
      throwing a packet into her lap. The old woman lifted up her hands to
      heaven, with the lease between them.&#8212;'Thanks be to Heaven!' Grace
      passed on, and sunk down on the first seat she could reach. Her face
      flushed, and, looking much fatigued, she loosened the strings of her
      bonnet and cloak&#8212;'Then, I'm tired;' but, recollecting herself, she
      rose, and curtsied to the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What tired ye, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, after prayers, we had to go&#8212;for the agent was not at prayers,
      nor at home for us, when we called&#8212;we had to go all the way up to
      the castle; and there, by great good luck, we found Mr. Nick Garraghty
      himself, come from Dublin, and the LASE in his hands; and he sealed it up
      that way, and handed it to me very civil. I never saw him so good&#8212;though
      he offered me a glass of spirits, which was not manners to a decent young
      woman, in a morning&#8212;as Brian noticed after. Brian would not take any
      either, nor never does. We met Mr. Dennis and the driver coming home; and
      he says, the rent must be paid to-morrow, or, instead of renewing, he'll
      seize and sell all. Mother dear, I would have dropped with the walk, but
      for Brian's arm.'&#8212;'It's a wonder, dear, what makes you so weak, that
      used to be so strong,'&#8212;'But if we can sell the cow for anything at
      all to Mr. Dennis, since his eye is set upon her, better let him have her,
      mother dear; and that and my yarn, which Mrs. Garraghty says she'll allow
      me for, will make up the rent&#8212;and Brian need not talk of America.
      But it must be in golden guineas, the agent will take the rent no other
      way; and you won't get a guinea for less than five shillings. Well, even
      so, it's easy selling my new gown to one that covets it, and that will
      give me in exchange the price of the gold; or, suppose that would not do,
      add this cloak,&#8212;it's handsome, and I know a friend would be glad to
      take it, and I'd part it as ready as look at it&#8212;Any-thing at all,
      sure, rather than that he should be forced to talk of emigrating; or, oh,
      worse again, listing for the bounty&#8212;to save us from the cant or the
      jail, by going to the hospital, or his grave, maybe&#8212;Oh, mother!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, child! This is what makes you weak, fretting. Don't be that way. Sure
      here's the LASE, and that's good comfort; and the soldiers will be gone
      out of Clonbrony to-morrow, and then that's off your mind. And as to
      America, it's only talk&#8212;I won't let him, he's dutiful; and would
      sooner sell my dresser and down to my bed, dear, than see you sell
      anything of yours, love. Promise me you won't. Why didn't Brian come home
      all the way with you, Grace?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He would have seen me home,' said Grace,' only that he went up a piece of
      the mountain for some stones or ore for the gentleman&#8212;for he had the
      manners to think of him this morning, though, shame for me, I had not,
      when I come in, or I would not have told you all this, and he himself by.
      See, there he is, mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Brian came in very hot, out of breath, with his hat full of stones. 'Good
      morrow to your honour. I was in bed last night; and sorry they did not
      call me up to be of SARVICE. Larry was telling us, this morning, your
      honour's from Wales, and looking for mines in Ireland, and I heard talk
      that there was one on our mountain&#8212;maybe, you'd be CUROUS to see,
      and so I brought the best I could, but I'm no judge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I, neither,' thought Lord Colambre; but he thanked the young man, and
      determined to avail himself of Larry's misconception or false report;
      examined the stones very gravely, and said, 'This promises well. Lapis
      caliminaris, schist, plum-pudding stone, rhomboidal, crystal, blend,
      garrawachy,' and all the strange names he could think of, jumbling them
      together at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The LASE!&#8212;Is it?' cried the young man, with joy sparkling in his
      eyes, as his mother held up the packet. 'Then all's safe! and he's an
      honest man, and shame on me, that could suspect he meant us wrong. Lend me
      the papers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He cracked the seals, and taking off the cover,&#8212;'It's the LASE, sure
      enough. Shame on me!&#8212;But stay, where's the memorandum?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's there, sure,' said his mother, 'where my lord's pencil writ it. I
      don't read.&#8212;Grace, dear, look.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man put it into her hands, and stood without power to utter a
      syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's not here! It's gone!&#8212;no sign of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gracious Heaven! that can't be,' said the old woman, putting on her
      spectacles; 'let me see&#8212;I remember the very spot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's taken away&#8212;it's rubbed clean out!&#8212;Oh, wasn't I fool? But
      who could have thought he'd be the villain!' The young man seemed neither
      to see nor hear; but to be absorbed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace, with her eyes fixed upon him, grew as pale as death&#8212;'He'll go&#8212;he's
      gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's gone!' cried Lord Colambre, and the mother just caught her in her
      arms as she was falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The chaise is ready, PLASE your honour,' said Larry, coming into the
      room. 'Death! what's here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Air!&#8212;she's coming to,' said the young man&#8212;'Take a drop of
      water, my own Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Young man, I, promise you,' cried Lord Colambre (speaking in the tone of
      a master), striking the young man's shoulder, who was kneeling at Grace's
      feet; but recollecting and restraining himself, he added, in a quiet voice&#8212;'I
      promise you I shall never forget the hospitality I have received in this
      house, and I am sorry to be obliged to leave you in distress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These words uttered with difficulty, he hurried out of the house, and into
      his carriage. 'Go back to them,' said he to the postillion; 'go back and
      ask whether, if I should stay a day or two longer in this country, they
      would let me return at night and lodge with them. And here, man, stay,
      take this,' putting money into his hands, 'for the good woman of the
      house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The postillion went in, and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She won't at all&#8212;I knew she would not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am obliged to her for the night's lodging she did give me; I have
      no right to expect more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?&#8212;Sure she bid me tell you&#8212;"and welcome to the
      lodging; for," said she, "he is a kind-hearted gentleman;" but here's the
      money; it's that I was telling you she would not have at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you. Now, my good friend Larry, drive me to Clonbrony, and do not
      say another word, for I'm not in a talking humour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry nodded, mounted, and drove to Clonbrony. Clonbrony was now a
      melancholy scene. The houses, which had been built in a better style of
      architecture than usual, were in a ruinous condition; the dashing was off
      the walls, no glass in the windows, and many of the roofs without slates.
      For the stillness of the place Lord Colambre in some measure accounted by
      considering that it was Sunday; therefore, of course, all the shops were
      shut up, and all the people at prayers. He alighted at the inn, which
      completely answered Larry's representation of it. Nobody to be seen but a
      drunken waiter, who, as well as he could articulate, informed Lord
      Colambre that 'his mistress was in her bed since Thursday-was-a-week; the
      hostler at the WASH-WOMAN'S, and the cook at second prayers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre walked to the church, but the church gate was locked and
      broken&#8212;a calf, two pigs, and an ass, in the churchyard; and several
      boys (with more of skin apparent than clothes) were playing at hustlecap
      upon a tombstone, which, upon nearer observation, he saw was the monument
      of his own family. One of the boys came to the gate, and told Lord
      Colambre 'there was no use in going into the church, becaase there was no
      church there; nor had not been this twelvemonth; becaase there was no
      curate; and the parson was away always, since the lord was at home&#8212;that
      is, was not at home&#8212;he nor the family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre returned to the inn, where, after waiting a considerable
      time, he gave up the point&#8212;he could not get any dinner&#8212;and in
      the evening he walked out again into the town. He found several
      ale-houses, however, open, which were full of people; all of them as busy
      and as noisy as possible. He observed that the interest was created by an
      advertisement of several farms on the Clonbrony estate, to be set by
      Nicholas Garraghty, Esq. He could not help smiling at his being witness
      incognito to various schemes for outwitting the agents and defrauding the
      landlord; but, on a sudden, the scene was changed; a boy ran in, crying
      out, that 'St. Dennis was riding down the hill into the town; and, if you
      would not have the license,' said the boy, 'take care of yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE LICENCE,' Lord Colambre perceived, by what
      followed, meant, 'IF YOU HAVE NOT A LICENCE.' Brannagan immediately
      snatched an untasted glass of whisky from a customer's lips (who cried,
      Murder!) gave it and the bottle he held in his hand to his wife, who
      swallowed the spirits, and ran away with the bottle and glass into some
      back hole; whilst the bystanders laughed, saying, 'Well thought of,
      Peggy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Clear out all of you at the back door, for the love of heaven, if you
      wouldn't be the ruin of me,' said the man of the house, setting a ladder
      to a corner of the shop. 'Phil, hoist me up the keg to the loft,' added
      he, running up the ladder; 'and one of YEES step up street, and give Rose
      M'Givney notice, for she's selling too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The keg was hoisted up; the ladder removed; the shop cleared of all the
      customers; the shutters shut; the door barred; the counter cleaned. 'Lift
      your stones, sir, if you plase,' said the wife, as she rubbed the counter,
      'and say nothing of what you SEEN at all; but that you're a stranger and a
      traveller seeking a lodging, if you're questioned, or waiting to see Mr.
      Dennis. There's no smell of whisky in it now, is there, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre could not flatter her so far as to say this&#8212;he could
      only hope no one would perceive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, and if he would, the smell of whisky was nothing,' as the wife
      affirmed, 'for it was everywhere in nature, and no proof again' any one,
      good or bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now St. Dennis may come when he will, or old Nick himself!' So she tied
      up a blue handkerchief over her head, and had the toothache, 'very bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre turned to look for the man of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's safe in bed,' said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In bed! When?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whilst you turned your head, while I was tying the handkerchief over my
      face. Within the room, look, he is snug.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And there he was in bed certainly, and his clothes on the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock, a loud knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'St. Dennis himself!&#8212;Stay, till I unbar the door,' said the woman;
      and, making a great difficulty, she let him in, groaning, and saying&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We was all done up for the night, PLASE your honour, and myself with the
      toothache, very bad&#8212;And the lodger, that's going to take an egg
      only, before he'd go into his bed. My man's in it, and asleep long ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With a magisterial air, though with a look of blank disappointment, Mr.
      Dennis Garraghty walked on, looked into THE ROOM, saw the good man of the
      house asleep, heard him snore, and then, returning, asked Lord Colambre
      'who he was, and what brought him there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero said he was from England, and a traveller; and now, bolder grown
      as a geologist, he talked of his specimens, and his hopes of finding a
      mine in the neighbouring mountains; then adopting, as well as he could,
      the servile tone and abject manner in which he found Mr. Dennis was to be
      addressed, 'he hoped he might get encouragement from the gentleman at the
      head of the estate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To bore, is it?&#8212;Well, don't BORE me about it. I can't give you any
      answer now, my good friend; I'm engaged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Out he strutted. 'Stick to him up the town, if you have a mind to get your
      answer,' whispered the woman. Lord Colambre followed, for he wished to see
      the end of this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir, what are you following and sticking to me, like my shadow,
      for?' said Mr. Dennis, turning suddenly upon Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship bowed low. 'Waiting for my answer, sir, when you are at
      leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, may I call upon you tomorrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem to be a civil kind of fellow; but, as to boring, I don't know&#8212;if
      you undertake it at your own expense. I dare say there may be minerals in
      the ground. Well, you may call at the castle to-morrow, and when my
      brother has done with the tenantry, I'll speak to him FOR you, and we'll
      consult together, and see what we think. It's too late to-night. In
      Ireland, nobody speaks to a gentleman about business after dinner&#8212;your
      servant, sir; anybody can show you the way to the castle in the morning.'
      And, pushing by his lordship, he called to a man on the other side of the
      street, who had obviously been waiting for him; he went under a gateway
      with this man, and gave him a bag of guineas. He then called for his
      horse, which was brought to him by a man whom Colambre had heard declaring
      that he would bid for the land that was advertised; whilst another, who
      had the same intentions, most respectfully held St. Dennis's stirrup,
      whilst he mounted without thanking either of these men. St. Dennis clapped
      spurs to his steed, and rode away. No thanks, indeed, were deserved; for
      the moment he was out of hearing, both cursed him after the manner of
      their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bad luck go with you, then!&#8212;And may you break your neck before you
      get home, if it was not for the LASE I'm to get, and that's paid for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre followed the crowd into a public-house, where a new scene
      presented itself to his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom St. Dennis gave the bag of gold was now selling this very
      gold to the tenants, who were to pay their rent next day at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent would take nothing but gold. The same guineas were bought and
      sold several times over, to the great profit of the agent and loss of the
      poor tenants; for, as the rents were paid, the guineas were resold to
      another set, and the remittances made through bankers to the landlord;
      who, as the poor man who explained the transaction to Lord Colambre
      expressed it, 'gained nothing by the business, bad or good, but the
      ill-will of the tenantry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The higgling for the price of the gold; the time lost in disputing about
      the goodness of the notes, among some poor tenants, who could not read or
      write, and who were at the mercy of the man with the bag in his hand; the
      vexation, the useless harassing of all who were obliged to submit
      ultimately&#8212;Lord Colambre saw; and all this time he endured the smell
      of tobacco and whisky, and of the sound of various brogues, the din of men
      wrangling, brawling, threatening, whining, drawling, cajoling, cursing,
      and every variety of wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And is this my father's town of Clonbrony?' thought Lord Colambre. 'Is
      this Ireland?&#8212;No, it is not Ireland. Let me not, like most of those
      who forsake their native country, traduce it. Let me not, even to my own
      mind, commit the injustice of taking a speck for the whole. What I have
      just seen is the picture only of that to which an Irish estate and Irish
      tenantry may be degraded in the absence of those whose duty and interest
      it is to reside in Ireland, to uphold justice by example and authority;
      but who, neglecting this duty, commit power to bad hands and bad hearts&#8212;abandon
      their tenantry to oppression, and their property to ruin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now fine moonlight, and Lord Colambre met with a boy, who said he
      could show him a short way across the fields to the widow O'Neill's
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      All were asleep at the cottage, when Lord Colambre arrived, except the
      widow, who was sitting up, waiting for him; and who had brought her dog
      into the house, that he might not fly at him, or bark at his return. She
      had a roast chicken ready for her guest, and it was&#8212;but this she
      never told him the only chicken she had left; all the others had been sent
      with the DUTY-FOWL as a present to the under-agent's lady. While he was
      eating his supper, which he ate with the better appetite, as he had had no
      dinner, the good woman took down from the shelf a pocket-book, which she
      gave him: 'Is not that your book?' said she. 'My boy Brian found it after
      you in the potato furrow, where you dropped it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you,' said Lord Colambre; 'there are bank notes in it, which I
      could not afford to lose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are there?' said she; 'he never opened it&#8212;nor I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in answer to his inquiries about Grace and the young man, the widow
      answered, 'They are all in heart now, I thank ye kindly, sir, for asking;
      they'll sleep easy to-night anyway, and I'm in great spirits for them and
      myself&#8212;for all's smooth now. After we parted you, Brian saw Mr.
      Dennis himself about the LASE and memorandum, which he never denied, but
      knew nothing about. "But, be that as it may," says he, "you're improving
      tenants, and I'm confident my brother will consider ye; so what you'll do
      is, you'll give up the possession to-morrow to myself, that will call for
      it by cock-crow, just for form's sake; and then go up to the castle with
      the new LASE ready drawn, in your hand, and if all's paid off clear of the
      rent, and all that's due, you'll get the new LASE signed; I'll promise you
      that upon the word and honour of a gentleman." And there's no going beyond
      that, you know, sir. So my boy came home as light as a feather, and as gay
      as a lark, to bring us the good news; only he was afraid we might not make
      up the rent, guineas and all; and because he could not get paid for the
      work he done, on account of the mistake in the overseer's tally, I sold
      the cow to a neighbour&#8212;dog-cheap; but needs must, as they say, when
      old Nick DRIVES,' said the widow, smiling. 'Well, still it was but paper
      we got for the cow; then that must be gold before the agent would take or
      touch it so I was laying out to sell the dresser, and had taken the plates
      and cups, and little things off it, and my boy was lifting it out with
      Andy the carpenter, that was agreeing for it, when in comes Grace, all
      rosy, and out of breath&#8212;it's a wonder I minded her run out, and not
      missed her. "Mother," says she, "here's the gold for you! don't be
      stirring your dresser."&#8212;"And where's your gown and cloak, Grace?"
      says I. But I beg your pardon, sir; maybe I'm tiring you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre encouraged her to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Where's your gown and cloak, Grace!" says I.&#8212;"Gone," says she.
      "The cloak was too warm and heavy, and I don't doubt, mother, but it was
      that helped to make me faint this morning. And as to the gown, sure I've a
      very nice one here, that you spun for me yourself, mother; and that I
      prize above all the gowns ever came out of a loom; and that Brian said
      become me to his fancy above any gown ever he see me wear; and what could
      I wish for more?" Now I'd a mind to scold her for going to sell the gown
      unknown'st to me, but I don't know how it was, I couldn't scold her just
      then, so kissed her, and Brian the same, and that was what no man ever did
      before. And she had a mind to be angry with him, but could not, nor ought
      not, says I; "for he's as good as your husband now, Grace; and no man can
      part yees now," says I, putting their hands together. Well, I never saw
      her look so pretty; nor there was not a happier boy that minute on God's
      earth than my son, nor a happier mother than myself; and I thanked God
      that had given them to me; and down they both fell on their knees for my
      blessing, little worth as it was; and my heart's blessing they had, and I
      laid my hands upon them. "It's the priest you must get to do this for you
      to-morrow," says I. And Brian just held up the ring, to show me all was
      ready on his part, but could not speak. "Then there's no America any
      more!" said Grace low to me, and her heart was on her lips; but the colour
      came and went, and I was AFEARED she'd have swooned again, but not for
      sorrow, so I carried her off. Well, if she was not my own&#8212;but she is
      not my own born so I may say it&#8212;there never was a better girl, nor a
      more kind-hearted, nor generous; never thinking anything she could do, or
      give, too much for them she loved, and anything at all would do for
      herself; the sweetest natured and tempered both, and always was, from this
      high; the bond that held all together, and joy of the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just like her namesake,' cried Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Plase your honour?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is not it late?' said Lord Colambre, stretching himself and gaping; 'I've
      walked a great way to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman lighted his rushlight, showed him to his red check bed, and
      wished him a very good night; not without some slight sentiment of
      displeasure at his gaping thus at the panegyric on her darling Grace.
      Before she left the room, however, her short-lived resentment vanished,
      upon his saying that he hoped, with her permission, to be present at the
      wedding of the young couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning Brian went to the priest, to ask his reverence when
      it would be convenient to marry him; and, whilst he was gone, Mr. Dennis
      Garraghty came to the cottage, to receive the rent and possession. The
      rent was ready, in gold, and counted into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No occasion for a receipt; for a new LASE is a receipt in full for
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, sir, said the widow; 'I know nothing of law. You know best&#8212;whatever
      you direct&#8212;for you are acting as a friend to us now. My son got the
      attorney to draw the pair of new LASES yesterday, and here they are ready,
      all to signing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dennis said his brother must settle that part of the business, and
      that they must carry them up to the castle; 'but first give me the
      possession.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he instructed her, she gave up the key of the door to him, and a
      bit of the thatch of the house; and he raked out the fire, and said every
      living creature must go out. 'It's only form of law,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And must my lodger get up and turn out, sir?' said she. 'He must turn
      out, to be sure&#8212;not a living soul must be left in it, or it's no
      legal possession properly. Who is your lodger?'
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lord Colambre's appearing, Mr. Dennis showed some surprise, and said,
      'I thought you were lodging at Brannagan's; are not you the man who spoke
      to me at his house about the gold mines?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir, he never lodged at Brannagan's,' said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, I am the person who spoke to you about the gold mines at
      Brannagan's; but I did not like to lodge&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no matter where you liked to lodge; you must walk out of this
      lodging now, if you please, my good friend.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Dennis pushed his lordship out by the shoulders, repeating, as the
      widow turned back and looked with some surprise and alarm, 'Only for form
      sake, only for form sake!' then locking the door, took the key, and put it
      into his pocket. The widow held out her hand for it: 'The form's gone
      through now, sir, is not it? Be plased to let us in again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When the new lease is signed, I'll give you possession again; but not
      till then&#8212;for that's the law. So make away with you to the castle;
      and mind,' added he, winking slily, 'mind you take sealing-money with you,
      and something to buy gloves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, where will I find all that?' said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have it, mother; don't fret,' said Grace. 'I have it&#8212;the price of&#8212;-what
      I can want. [What I can do without.] So let us go off to the castle
      without delay. Brian will meet us on the road, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off for Clonbrony Castle, Lord Colambre accompanying them. Brian
      met them on the road. 'Father Tom is ready, dear mother; bring her in, and
      he'll marry us. I'm not my own man till she's mine. Who knows what may
      happen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who knows? that's true,' said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better go to the castle first,' said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And keep the priest waiting! You can't use his reverence so.' said Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she let him lead her into the priest's house, and she did not make any
      of the awkward draggings back, or ridiculous scenes of grimace sometimes
      exhibited on these occasions; but blushing rosy red, yet with more
      self-possession than could have been expected from her timid nature, she
      gave her hand to the man she loved, and listened with attentive devotion
      to the holy ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!' thought Lord Colambre, whilst he congratulated the bride, 'shall I
      ever be as happy as these poor people are at this moment?' He longed to
      make them some little present, but all he could venture at this moment was
      to pay the priest's DUES.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest positively refused to take anything. 'They are the best couple
      in my parish,' said he; 'and I'll take nothing, sir, from you, a stranger
      and my guest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, come what will, I'm a match for it. No trouble can touch me,' said
      Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, don't be bragging,' said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever trouble God sends, He has given one now will help to bear it,
      and sure I may be thankful,' said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such good hearts must be happy&#8212;shall be happy!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you're very kind,' said the widow, smiling; 'and I wouldn't doubt
      you, if you had the power. I hope, then, the agent will give you
      encouragement about them mines, that we may keep you among us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am determined to settle among you, warm-hearted, generous people!'
      cried Lord Colambre, 'whether the agent gives me encouragement or not,'
      added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long walk to Clonbrony Castle; the old woman, as she said
      herself, would not have been able for it, but for a LIFT given to her by a
      friendly carman, whom they met on the road with an empty car. This carman
      was Finnucan, who dissipated Lord Colambre's fears of meeting and being
      recognised by Mrs. Raffarty; for he, in answer to the question of, 'Who is
      at the castle?' replied, 'Mrs. Raffarty will be in it afore night; but
      she's on the road still. There's none but old Nick in it yet; and he's
      more of a NEGER than ever; for think, that he would not pay me a farthing
      for the carriage of his SHISTER'S boxes and bandboxes down. If you're
      going to have any dealings with him, God grant ye a safe deliverance!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Amen!' said the widow, and her son and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre's attention was now engaged by the view of the castle and
      park of Clonbrony. He had not seen it since he was six years old. Some
      faint reminiscence from his childhood made him feel or fancy that he knew
      the place. It was a fine castle, spacious park; but all about it, from the
      broken piers at the great entrance, to the messy gravel and loose steps at
      the hall-door, had an air of desertion and melancholy. Walks overgrown,
      shrubberies wild, plantations run up into bare poles; fine trees cut down,
      and lying on the gravel in lots to be sold. A hill that had been covered
      with an oak wood, in which, in his childhood, our hero used to play, and
      which he called the black forest, was gone; nothing to be seen but the
      white stumps of the trees, for it had been freshly cut down, to make up
      the last remittances.&#8212;'And how it went, when sold!&#8212;but no
      matter,' said Finnucan; 'it's all alike.&#8212;It's the back way into the
      yard, I'll take you, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And such a yard! 'But it's no matter,' repeated Lord Colambre to himself;
      'it's all alike.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the kitchen a great dinner was dressing for Mr. Garraghty's friends,
      who were to make merry with him when the business of the day was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's the keys of the cellar, till I get out the claret for after
      dinner,' says one; 'and the wine for the cook&#8212;sure there's venison,'
      cries another.&#8212;'Venison!&#8212;That's the way my lord's deer goes,'
      says a third, laughing.&#8212;'ay, sure! and very proper, when he's not
      here to eat 'em.'&#8212;'Keep your nose out of the kitchen, young man, if
      you PLASE,' said the agent's cook, shutting the door in Lord Colambre's
      face. 'There's the way to the office, if you've money to pay, up the back
      stairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; up the grand staircase they must&#8212;Mr. Garraghty ordered,' said
      the footman; 'because the office is damp for him, and it's not there he'll
      see anybody to-day; but in my lady's dressing-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So up the grand staircase they went, and through the magnificent
      apartments, hung with pictures of great value, spoiling with damp. 'Then,
      isn't it a pity to see them? There's my lady, and all spoiling,' said the
      widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre stopped before a portrait of Miss Nugent.&#8212;'Shamefully
      damaged!' cried he. 'Pass on, or let me pass, if you PLASE,' said one of
      the tenants; 'and don't be stopping the doorway.' 'I have business more
      nor you with the agent,' said the surveyor; 'where is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the PRESENCE-CHAMBER,' replied another; 'where should the viceroy be
      but in the PRESENCE-CHAMBER?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a full levee, and fine smell of greatcoats. 'Oh! would you put
      your hats on the silk cushions?' said the widow to some men in the
      doorway, who were throwing off their greasy hats on a damask sofa.&#8212;'Why
      not? where else?' 'If the lady was in it, you wouldn't,' said she,
      sighing.&#8212;'No, to be sure, I wouldn't; great news! would I make no
      DIFFER in the presence of old Nick and my lady?' said he, in Irish. 'Have
      I no sense or manners, good woman, think ye?' added he, as he shook the
      ink out of his pen on the Wilton carpet, when he had finished signing his
      name to a paper on his knee. 'You may wait long before you get to the
      speech of the great man,' said another, who was working his way through
      numbers. They continued pushing forward, till they came within sight of
      Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, seated in state; and a worse countenance, or a
      more perfect picture of an insolent, petty tyrant in office, Lord Colambre
      had never beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forbear all further detail of this levee. 'It's all the same!' as Lord
      Colambre repeated to himself, on every fresh instance of roguery or
      oppression to which he was witness; and, having completely made up his
      mind on the subject, he sat down quietly in the background, waiting till
      it should come to the widow's turn to be dealt with, for he was now
      interested only to see how she would be treated. The room gradually
      thinned; Mr. Dennis Garraghty came in, and sat down at the table, to help
      his brother to count the heaps of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr. Dennis, I'm glad to see you as kind as your promise, meeting me
      here,' said the widow O'Neill, walking up to him; 'I'm sure you'll speak a
      good word for me; here's the LASES&#8212;who will I offer this to?' said
      she, holding the GLOVE-MONEY and SEALING-MONEY,&#8212;'for I'm strange and
      ashamed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, don't be ashamed&#8212;there's no strangeness in bringing money or
      taking it,' said Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, holding out his hand. 'Is this
      the proper compliment?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope so, sir; your honour knows best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' slipping it into his private purse. 'Now, what's your
      business?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The LASES to sign&#8212;the rent's all paid up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Leases! Why, woman, is the possession given up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was, PLASE your honour; and Mr. Dennis has the key of our little place
      in his pocket.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I hope he'll keep it there. YOUR little place&#8212;it's no longer
      yours; I've promised it to the surveyor. You don't think I'm such a fool
      as to renew to you at this rent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Dennis named the rent. But anything your honour PLASES&#8212;anything
      at all that we can pay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it's out of the question&#8212;put it out of your head. No rent you
      can offer would do, for I've promised it to the surveyor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir, Mr. Dennis knows my lord gave us his promise in writing of a
      renewal, on the back of the OULD LASE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Produce it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's the LASE, but the promise is rubbed out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense! coming to me with a promise that's rubbed out. Who'll listen to
      that in a court of justice, do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know, plase your honour; but this I'm sure of, my lord and Miss
      Nugent, though but a child at the time, God bless her! who was by when my
      lord wrote it with his pencil, will remember it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Nugent! what can she know of business?&#8212;What has she to do with
      the management of my Lord Clonbrony's estate, pray?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Management!&#8212;no, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you wish to get Miss Nugent turned out of the house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, God forbid!&#8212;how could that be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very easily; if you set about to make her meddle and witness in what my
      lord does not choose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well then, I'll never mention Miss Nugent's name in it at all, if it was
      ever so with me. But be PLASED, sir, to write over to my lord, and ask
      him; I'm sure he'll remember it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Write to my lord about such a trifle&#8212;trouble him about such
      nonsense!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd be sorry to trouble him. Then take it on my word, and believe me,
      sir; for I would not tell a lie, nor cheat rich or poor, if in my power,
      for the whole estate, nor the whole world: for there's an eye above.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cant! nonsense!&#8212;Take those leases off the table; I never will sign
      them. Walk off; ye canting hag; it's an imposition&#8212;I will never sign
      them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You WILL then, sir,' cried Brian, growing red with indignation; 'for the
      law shall make you, so it shall; and you'd as good have been civil to my
      mother, whatever you did&#8212;for I'll stand by her while I've life; and
      I know she has right, and shall have law. I saw the memorandum written
      before ever it went into your hands, sir, whatever became of it after; and
      will swear to it, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Swear away, my good friend; much your swearing will avail in your own
      case in a court of justice,' continued old Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And against a gentleman of my brother's established character and
      property,' said St. Dennis. 'What's your mother's character against a
      gentleman's like his?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Character! take care how you go to that, anyway, sir,' cried Brian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace put her hand before his mouth, to stop him. 'Grace, dear, I must
      speak, if I die for it; sure it's for my mother,' said the young man,
      struggling forward, while his mother held him back; 'I must speak.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, he's ruin'd, I see it,' said Grace, putting her hand before her eyes,
      'and he won't mind me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on, let him go on, pray, young woman,' said Mr. Garraghty, pale with
      anger and fear, his lips quivering; 'I shall be happy to take down his
      words.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Write them; and may all the world read it, and welcome!' His mother and
      wife stopped his mouth by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Write you, Dennis,' said Mr. Garraghty, giving the pen to his brother;
      for his hand shook so he could not form a letter. 'Write the very words,
      and at the top' (pointing) after warning, WITH MALICE PREPENSE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Write, then&#8212;mother, Grace&#8212;let me,' cried Brian, speaking in a
      smothered voice, as their hands were over his mouth. 'Write then, that, if
      you'd either of you a character like my mother, you might defy the world;
      and your word would be as good as your oath.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'OATH! mind that, Dennis,' said Mr. Garraghty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, sir! sir! won't you stop him?' cried Grace, turning suddenly to Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dear, dear, if you haven't lost your feeling for us,' cried the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let him speak,' said Lord Colambre, in a tone of authority; 'let the
      voice of truth be heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'TRUTH!' cried St. Dennis, and dropped the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And who the devil are you, sir?' said old Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre, I protest!' exclaimed a female voice; and Mrs. Raffarty at
      this instant appeared at the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre!' repeated all present, in different tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, I beg pardon;' continued Mrs. Raffarty, advancing as if her legs
      were tied; 'had I known you was down here, I would not have presumed. I'd
      better retire; for I see you're busy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd best; for you're mad, sister,' said St. Dennis, pushing her back;
      'and we are busy; go to your room, and keep quiet, if you can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'First, madam,' said Lord Colambre, going between her and the door, 'let
      me beg that you will consider yourself as at home in this house, whilst
      any circumstances make it desirable to you. The hospitality you showed me
      you cannot think that I now forget.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my lord, you're too good&#8212;how few&#8212;too kind&#8212;kinder
      than my own,' and bursting into tears, she escaped out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre returned to the party round the table, who were in various
      attitudes of astonishment, and with faces of fear, horror, hope, joy,
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Distress,' continued his lordship, 'however incurred, if not by vice,
      will always find a refuge in this house. I speak in my father's name, for
      I know I speak his sentiments. But never more shall vice,' said he,
      darting such a look at the brother agents as they felt to the backbone&#8212;'never
      more shall vice, shall fraud enter here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and there was a momentary silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There spoke the true thing! and the RAEL gentleman; my own heart's
      satisfied,' said Brian, folding his arms, and standing erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then so is mine,' said Grace, taking breath, with a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow advancing, put on her spectacles, and, looking up close at Lord
      Colambre's face&#8212;'Then it's a wonder I didn't know the family
      likeness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre now recollecting that he still wore the old greatcoat, threw
      it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, bless him! Then now I'd know him anywhere. I'm willing to die now,
      for we'll all be happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, since it is so&#8212;my lord, may I ask you,' said Mr.
      Garraghty, now sufficiently recovered to be able to articulate, but
      scarcely to express his ideas; 'if what your lordship hinted just now&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hinted nothing, sir; I spoke plainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg pardon, my lord,' said old Nick;&#8212;'respecting vice, was
      levelled at me; because, if it was, my lord,' trying to stand erect; 'let
      me tell your lordship, if I could think it was&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it did not hit you, sir, no matter at whom it was levelled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And let me ask, my lord, if I may presume, whether, in what you suggested
      by the word fraud, your lordship had any particular meaning?' said St.
      Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very particular meaning, sir,&#8212;feel in your pocket for the key of
      this widow's house, and deliver it to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, if that's all the meaning, with all the pleasure in life. I never
      meant to detain it longer than till the leases were signed,' said St.
      Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I'm ready to sign the leases this minute,' said the brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do it, sir, this minute; I have read them; I will be answerable to my
      father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, as to that, my lord, I have power to sign for your father.' He signed
      the leases; they were duly witnessed by Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I deliver this as my act and deed,' said Mr. Garraghty;&#8212;'My lord,'
      continued he, 'you see, at the first word from you; and had I known sooner
      the interest you took in the family, there would have been no difficulty;
      for I'd make it a principle to oblige you, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oblige me!' said Lord Colambre, with disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But when gentlemen and noblemen travel INCOGNITO, and lodge in cabins,'
      added St. Dennis, with a satanic smile, glancing his eye on Grace, 'they
      have good reasons, no doubt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do not judge my heart by your own, sir,' said Lord Colambre, coolly; 'no
      two things in nature can, I trust, be more different. My purpose in
      travelling INCOGNITO has been fully answered: I was determined to see and
      judge how my father's estates were managed; and I have seen, compared, and
      judged. I have seen the difference between the Clonbrony and the Colambre
      property; and I shall represent what I have seen to my father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As to that, my lord, if we are to come to that but I trust your lordship
      will suffer me to explain these matters.&#8212;Go about your business, my
      good friends; you have all you want;&#8212;and, my lord, after dinner,
      when you are cool, I hope I shall be able to make you sensible that things
      have been represented to your lordship in a mistaken light; and I flatter
      myself I shall convince you I have not only always acted the part of a
      friend to the family, but am particularly willing to conciliate your
      lordship's goodwill,' said he, sweeping the rouleaus of gold into a bag;
      'any accommodation in my power, at any time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want no accommodation, sir,&#8212;were I starving, I would accept of
      none from you. Never can you conciliate my goodwill; for you can never
      deserve it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If that be the case, my lord, I must conduct myself accordingly; but it's
      fair to warn you, before you make any representation to my Lord Clonbrony,
      that if he should think of changing his agent, there are accounts to be
      settled between us&#8212;that may be a consideration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir; no consideration&#8212;my father never shall be the slave of
      such a paltry consideration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, very well, my lord; you know best. If you choose to make an
      assumpsit, I'm sure I shall not object to the security. Your lordship will
      be of age soon, I know&#8212;I'm sure I'm satisfied&#8212;but,' added he
      with a malicious smile, 'I rather apprehend you don't know what you
      undertake; I only premise that the balance of accounts between us is not
      what can properly be called a paltry consideration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On that point, perhaps, sir, you and I may differ.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, my lord, you will follow your own principles, if it suits your
      convenience.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whether it does or not, sir, I shall abide by my principles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dennis! the letters to the post.&#8212;When do you go to England, my
      lord?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Immediately, sir,' said Lord Colambre; his lordship saw new leases from
      his father to Mr. Dennis Garraghty, lying on the table, unsigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Immediately!' repeated Messrs. Nicholas and Dennis, with an air of
      dismay. Nicholas got up, looked out of the window, and whispered something
      to his brother, who instantly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre saw the post-chaise at the door, which had brought Mrs.
      Raffarty to the castle, and Larry standing beside it; his lordship
      instantly threw up the sash, and holding between his finger and thumb a
      six-shilling piece, cried, 'Larry, my friend, let me have the horses!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You shall have 'em&#8212;your honour,' said Larry. Mr. Dennis Garraghty
      appeared below, speaking in a magisterial tone. 'Larry, my brother must
      have the horses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He can't, PLASE your honour&#8212;they're engaged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a crown! a crown!&#8212;half a guinea!' said Mr. Dennis Garraghty,
      raising his voice, as he increased his proffered bribe. To each offer
      Larry replied, 'You can't, PLASE your honour, they're engaged;'&#8212;and,
      looking up to the window at Lord Colambre, he said, 'as soon as they have
      eaten their oats, you shall have 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No other horses were to be had. The agent was in consternation. Lord
      Colambre ordered that Larry should have some dinner, and whilst the
      postillion was eating, and the horses finishing their oats, his lordship
      wrote the following letter to his father, which, to prevent all
      possibility of accident, he determined to put, with his own hand, into the
      post-office at Clonbrony, as he passed through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR FATHER, I hope to be with you in a few days. Lest anything should
      detain me on the road, I write this, to make an earnest request to you,
      that you will not sign any papers, or transact any farther business with
      Messrs. Nicholas or Dennis Garraghty, before you see your affectionate
      son, COLAMBRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses came out. Larry sent word he was ready, and Lord Colambre,
      having first eaten a slice of his own venison, ran down to the carriage,
      followed by the thanks and blessings of the widow, her son, and daughter,
      who could hardly make their way after him to the chaise-door, so great was
      the crowd which had gathered on the report of his lordship's arrival.
      'Long life to your honour! Long life to your lordship!' echoed on all
      sides. 'Just come, and going, are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye to you all, good people!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then GOOD-BYE is the only word we wouldn't wish to hear from your
      honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For the sake both of landlord and tenant, I must leave you now, my good
      friends; but I hope to return to you at some future time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God bless you! and speed ye! and a safe journey to your honour!&#8212;and
      a happy return to us, and soon!' cried a multitude of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre stopped at the chaise-door and beckoned to the widow
      O'Neill, before whom others had pressed. An opening was made for her
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There! that was the very way his father stood with his feet on the steps.
      And Miss Nugent was IN IT.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre forgot what he was going to say&#8212;with some difficulty
      recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This pocket-book,' said he, 'which your son restored to me&#8212;I intend
      it for your daughter&#8212;don't keep it, as your son kept it for me,
      without opening it. Let what is within-side,' added he, as he got into the
      carriage, 'replace the cloak and gown, and let all things necessary for a
      bride be bought; "for the bride that has all things to borrow has surely
      mickle to do."&#8212;Shut the door, and drive on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blessings be WID you,' cried the widow, 'and God give you grace!'

      Larry drove off at full gallop, and kept on at a good rate, till he got
      out of the great gate, and beyond the sight of the crowd; then, pulling
      up, he turned to Lord Colambre&#8212;'PLASE your honour, I did not know
      nor guess ye was my lord, when I let you have the horses; did not know who
      you was from Adam, I'll take my affidavit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's no occasion,' said Lord Colambre; 'I hope you don't repent
      letting me have the horses, now you do know who I am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! not at all, sure; I'm as glad as the best horse I ever crossed, that
      your honour is my lord&#8212;but I was only telling your honour, that you
      might not be looking upon me as a TIME-SERVER.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not look upon you as a TIME-SERVER, Larry; but keep on, that time
      may serve me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In two words, he explained his cause of haste; and no sooner explained
      than understood. Larry thundered away through the town of Clonbrony,
      bending over his horses, plying the whip, and lending his very soul at
      every lash. With much difficulty, Lord Colambre stopped him at the end of
      the town, at the post-office. The post was gone out-gone a quarter of an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe we'll overtake the mail,' said Larry; and, as he spoke, he slid
      down from his seat, and darted into the public-house, reappearing, in a
      few moments, with a copper of ale and a horn in his hand; he and another
      man held open the horses' mouths, and poured the ale through the horn down
      their throats. 'Now, they'll go with spirit!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with the hope of overtaking the mail, Larry made them go 'for life or
      death,' as he said; but in vain! At the next stage, at his own inn-door,
      Larry roared for fresh horses till he got them, harnessed them with his
      own hands, holding the six-shilling piece, which Lord Colambre had given
      him, in his mouth, all the while; for he could not take time to put it
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Speed ye! I wish I was driving you all the way, then,' said he. The other
      postillion was not yet ready. 'Then your honour sees,' said he, putting
      his head into the carriage, 'CONSARNING of them Garraghties&#8212;old Nick
      and St. Dennis&#8212;the best part, that is the worst part, of what I told
      you, proved true; and I'm glad of it, that is, I'm sorry for it&#8212;but
      glad your honour knows it in time. So Heaven prosper you! And may all the
      saints (BARRING St. Dennis) have charge of you, and all belonging to you,
      till we see you here again!&#8212;And when will it be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot say when I shall return to you myself, but I will do my best to
      send your landlord to you soon. In the meantime, my good fellow, keep away
      from the sign of the Horse-shoe&#8212;a man of your sense to drink and
      make an idiot and a brute of yourself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True!&#8212;And it was only when I had lost hope I took to it&#8212;but
      now! Bring me the book, one of YEES, out of the landlady's parlour.&#8212;By
      the virtue of this book, and by all the books that ever was shut and
      opened, I won't touch a drop of spirits, good or bad, till I see your
      honour again, or some of the family, this time twelvemonth&#8212;that long
      I'll live on hope&#8212;but mind, if you disappoint me, I don't swear but
      I'll take to the whisky, for comfort, all the rest of my days. But don't
      be staying here, wasting your time, advising me. Bartley! take the reins,
      can't ye?' cried he, giving them to the fresh postillion; 'and keep on,
      for your life, for there's thousands of pounds depending on the race&#8212;so,
      off, off, Bartley, with speed of light!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartley did his best; and such was the excellence of the roads, that,
      notwithstanding the rate at which our hero travelled, he arrived safely in
      Dublin, and just in time to put his letter into the post-office, and to
      sail in that night's packet. The wind was fair when Lord Colambre went on
      board, but before they got out of the bay it changed; they made no way all
      night; in the course of the next day, they had the mortification to see
      another packet from Dublin sail past them, and when they landed at
      Holyhead, were told the packet, which had left Ireland twelve hours after
      them, had been in an hour before them. The passengers had taken their
      places in the coach, and engaged what horses could be had. Lord Colambre
      was afraid that Mr. Garraghty was one of them; a person exactly answering
      his description had taken four horses, and set out half an hour before in
      great haste for London. Luckily, just as those who had taken their places
      in the mail were getting into the coach, Lord Colambre saw among them a
      gentleman, with whom he had been acquainted in Dublin, a barrister, who
      was come over during the long vacation, to make a tour of pleasure in
      England. When Lord Colambre explained the reason he had for being in haste
      to reach London, he had the good-nature to give up to him his place in the
      coach. Lord Colambre travelled all night, and delayed not one moment, till
      he reached his father's house in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father at home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, my lord, in his own room&#8212;the agent from Ireland with him, on
      particular business&#8212;desired not to be interrupted&#8212;but I'll go
      and tell him, my lord, you are come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre ran past the servant, as he spoke&#8212;made his way into
      the room&#8212;found his father, Sir Terence O'Fay, and Mr. Garraghty&#8212;leases
      open on the table before them; a candle lighted; Sir Terence sealing;
      Garraghty emptying a bag of guineas on the table, and Lord Clonbrony
      actually with a pen in his hand, ready to sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door opened, Garraghty started back, so that half the contents of
      his bag rolled upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop, my dear father, I conjure you,' cried Lord Colambre, springing
      forward, and kneeling to his father; at the same moment snatching the pen
      from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colambre! God bless you, my dear boy! at all events. But how came you
      here?&#8212;And what do you mean?' said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Burn it!' cried Sir Terence, pinching the sealing-wax; 'for I burnt
      myself with the pleasure of the surprise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Garraghty, without saying a word, was picking up the guineas that were
      scattered upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How fortunate I am,' cried Lord Colambre, 'to have arrived just in time
      to tell you, my dear father, before you put your signature to these
      papers, before you conclude this bargain, all I know, all I have seen, of
      that man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nick Garraghty, honest old Nick; do you know him, my lord?' said Sir
      Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too well, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Garraghty, what have you done to offend my son? I did not expect
      this,' said Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my conscience, my lord, nothing to my knowledge,' said Mr.
      Garraghty, picking up the guineas; 'but showed him every civility, even so
      far as offering to accommodate him with cash without security; and where
      will you find the other agent, in Ireland or anywhere else, will do that?
      To my knowledge, I never did anything, by word or deed, to offend my Lord
      Colambre; nor could not, for I never saw him, but for ten minutes, in my
      days; and then he was in such a foaming passion&#8212;begging his
      lordship's pardon&#8212;owing to the misrepresentations he met with of me,
      I presume, from a parcel of blackguards that he went amongst, INCOGNITO,
      he would not let me or my brother Dennis say a word to set him right; but
      exposed me before all the tenantry, and then threw himself into a hack,
      and drove off here, to stop the signing of these leases, I perceive. But I
      trust,' concluded he, putting the replenished money-bag down with a heavy
      sound on the table, opposite to Lord Clonbrony,&#8212;'I trust, my Lord
      Clonbrony will do me justice; that's all I have to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I comprehend the force of your last argument fully, sir,' said Lord
      Colambre. 'May I ask how many guineas there are in the bag? I don't ask
      whether they are my father's or not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are to be your lordship's father's, sir, if he thinks proper,'
      replied Garraghty. 'How many, I don't know that I can justly, positively
      say&#8212;five hundred, suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And they would be my father's if he signed those leases&#8212;I
      understand that perfectly, and understand that my father would lose three
      times that sum by the bargain.&#8212;My dear father, you start&#8212;but
      it is true. Is not this the rent, sir, at which you were going to let Mr.
      Garraghty have the land?' placing a paper before Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is&#8212;the very thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And here, sir, written with my own hand, are copies of the proposals I
      saw, from responsible, respectable tenants, offered and refused.&#8212;Is
      it so, or is it not, Mr. Garraghty?&#8212;deny it, if you can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garraghty grew pale; his lips quivered; he stammered; and, after a
      shocking convulsion of face, could at last articulate&#8212;only&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'That there was a great difference between tenant and tenant, his lordship
      must be sensible, especially for so large a rent.'&#8212;'As great a
      difference as between agent and agent, I am sensible&#8212;especially for
      so large a property!' said Lord Colambre, with cool contempt. 'You find,
      sir, I am well informed with regard to this transaction; you will find,
      also, that I am equally well informed with respect to every part of your
      conduct towards my father and his tenantry. If, in relating to him what I
      have seen and heard, I should make any mistakes, you are here; and I am
      glad you are, to set me right, and to do yourself justice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! as to that, I should not presume to contradict anything your lordship
      asserts from your own authority: where would be the use? I leave it all to
      your lordship. But, as it is not particularly agreeable to stay to hear
      one's self abused&#8212;Sir Terence! I'll thank you to hand me my hat!&#8212;And
      if you'll have the goodness, my Lord Clonbrony, to look over finally the
      accounts before morning, I'll call at your leisure to settle the balance,
      as you find convenient; as to the leases, I'm quite indifferent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took up his money-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you'll call again in the morning, Mr. Garraghty!' said Sir Terence;
      'and, by that time, I hope we shall understand this misunderstanding
      better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence pulled Lord Clonbrony's sleeve: 'Don't let him go with the
      money&#8212;it's much wanted!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let him go,' said Lord Colambre; 'money can be had by honourable means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wheugh!&#8212;He talks as if he had the Bank of England at his command,
      as every young man does,' said Sir Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre deigned no reply. Lord Clonbrony walked undecidedly between
      his agent and his son&#8212;looked at Sir Terence, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garraghty departed; Lord Clonbrony called after him from the head of
      the stairs,
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall be at home and at leisure in the morning.' Sir Terence ran
      downstairs after him; Lord Colambre waited quietly for their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fifteen hundred guineas, at a stroke of a goose-quill!&#8212;That was a
      neat hit, narrowly missed, of honest Nick's!' said Lord Clonbrony. 'Too
      bad! too bad, faith!&#8212;I am much, very much obliged to you, Colambre,
      for that hint; by to-morrow morning we shall have him in another tune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he must double the bag, or quit,' said Sir Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Treble it, if you please, Terry. Sure, three times five's fifteen;&#8212;fifteen
      hundred down, or he does not get my signature to those leases for his
      brother, nor get the agency of the Colambre estate.&#8212;Colambre, what
      more have you to tell of him? for, since he is making out his accounts
      against me, it is no harm to have a PER CONTRA against him that may ease
      my balance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very fair! very fair!' said Sir Terence. 'My lord, trust me for
      remembering all the charges against him&#8212;every item; and when he
      can't clear himself, if I don't make him buy a good character dear enough,
      why, say I'm a fool, and don't know the value of character, good or bad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you know the value of character, Sir Terence,' said Lord Colambre,
      'you know that it is not to be bought or sold.' Then, turning from Sir
      Terence to his father, he gave a full and true account of all he had seen
      in his progress through his Irish estates; and drew a faithful picture
      both of the bad and good agent. Lord Clonbrony, who had benevolent
      feelings, and was fond of his tenantry, was touched; and, when his son
      ceased speaking, repeated several times&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rascal! rascal! How dare he use my tenants so&#8212;the O'Neills in
      particular!&#8212;Rascal! bad heart!-I'll have no more to do with him.'
      But, suddenly recollecting himself, he turned to Sir Terence, and added,
      'That's sooner said than done&#8212;I'll tell you honestly, Colambre, your
      friend Mr. Burke may be the best man in the world&#8212;but he is the
      worst man to apply to for a remittance, or a loan, in a HURRY! He always
      tells me "he can't distress the tenants."'&#8212;'And he never, at coming
      into the agency even,' said Sir Terence, 'ADVANCED a good round sum to the
      landlord, by way of security for his good behaviour. Now honest Nick did
      that much for us at coming in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And at going out is he not to be repaid?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the devil!' said Lord Clonbrony; that's the very reason I can't
      conveniently turn him out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will make it convenient to you, sir, if you will permit me,' said Lord
      Colambre. 'In a few days I shall be of age, and will join with you in
      raising whatever sum you want, to free you from this man. Allow me to look
      over his account; and whatever the honest balance may be, let him have
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear boy!' said Lord Clonbrony, 'you're a generous fellow. Fine Irish
      heart!&#8212;glad you're my son! But there's more, much more, that you
      don't know,' added he, looking at Sir Terence, who cleared his throat; and
      Lord Clonbrony, who was on the point of opening all his affairs to his
      son, stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre,' said he, 'we will not say anything more of this at present;
      for nothing effectual can be done till you are of age, and then we shall
      see all about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre perfectly understood what his father meant, and what was
      meant by the clearing of Sir Terence's throat. Lord Clonbrony wanted his
      son to join him in opening the estate to pay his debts; and Sir Terence
      feared that, if Lord Colambre were abruptly told the whole sum total of
      the debts he would never be persuaded to join in selling or mortgaging so
      much of his patrimony as would be necessary for their payment. Sir Terence
      thought that the young man, ignorant probably of business, and
      unsuspicious of the state of his father's affairs, might be brought, by
      proper management, to any measures they desired. Lord Clonbrony wavered
      between the temptation to throw himself upon the generosity of his son,
      and the immediate convenience of borrowing a sum of money from his agent,
      to relieve his present embarrassments.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing can be settled,' repeated he, 'till Colambre is of age; so it
      does not signify talking of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why so, sir?' said Lord Colambre. 'Though my act, in law, may not be
      valid, till I am of age, my promise, as a man of honour, is binding now;
      and, I trust, would be as satisfactory to my father as any legal deed
      whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Undoubtedly, my dear boy; but&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what?' said Lord Colambre, following his father's eye, which turned
      to Sir Terence O'Fay, as if asking his permission to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As my father's friend, sir, you ought, permit me to say, at this moment
      to use your influence to prevail upon him to throw aside all reserve with
      a son, whose warmest wish is to serve him, and to see him at ease and
      happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Generous, dear boy,' cried Lord Clonbrony. 'Terence, I can't stand it;
      but how shall I bring myself to name the amount of the debts?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At some time or other, I must know it,' said Lord Colambre; 'I cannot be
      better prepared at any moment than the present; never more disposed to
      give my assistance to relieve all difficulties. Blindfold, I cannot be led
      to any purpose, sir,' said he, looking at Sir Terence; 'the attempt would
      be degrading and futile. Blindfolded I will not be&#8212;but, with my eyes
      open, I will see, and go straight and prompt as heart can go, to my
      father's interest, without a look or thought to my own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By St. Patrick! the spirit of a prince, and an Irish prince, spoke
      there,' cried Sir Terence; 'and if I'd fifty hearts, you'd have all in
      your hand this minute, at your service, and warm. Blindfold you! after
      that, the man that would attempt it DESARVES to be shot; and I'd have no
      sincerer pleasure in life than shooting him this moment, was he my best
      friend. But it's not Clonbrony, or your father, my lord, would act that
      way, no more than Sir Terence O'Fay&#8212;there's the schedule of the
      debts,' drawing a paper from his bosom; 'and I'll swear to the lot, and
      not a man on earth could do that but myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre opened the paper. His father turned aside, covering his face
      with both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tut, man,' said Sir Terence; 'I know him now better than you; he will
      stand, you'll find, the shock of that regiment of figures&#8212;he is
      steel to the backbone, and proof spirit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thank you, my dear father,' said Lord Colambre, 'for trusting me thus
      at once with a view of the truth. At first sight it is, I acknowledge,
      worse than I expected; but I make no doubt that, when you allow me to
      examine Mr. Garraghty's accounts and Mr. Mordicai's claims, we shall be
      able to reduce this alarming total considerably, my dear father. You think
      we learn nothing but Latin and Greek at Cambridge; but you are mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil a pound, nor a penny,' said Sir Terence; 'for you have to deal
      with a Jew and old Nick; and I'm not a match for them. I don't know who
      is; and I have no hope of getting any abatement. I've looked over the
      accounts till I'm sick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nevertheless, you will observe that fifteen hundred guineas have been
      saved to my father, at one stroke, by his not signing those leases.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Saved to you, my lord; not your father, if you plase,' said Sir Terence.
      'For now I'm upon the square with you, I must be straight as an arrow, and
      deal with you as the son and friend of my friend; before, I was
      considering you only as the son and heir, which is quite another thing,
      you know; accordingly, acting for your father here, I was making the best
      bargain against you I could; honestly, now, I tell you. I knew the value
      of the lands well enough; we were as sharp as Garraghty, and he knew it;
      we were to have had THE DIFFERENCE from him, partly in cash and partly in
      balance of accounts&#8212;you comprehend&#8212;and you only would have
      been the loser, and never would have known it, maybe, till after we all
      were dead and buried; and then you might have set aside Garraghty's lease
      easy, and no harm done to any but a rogue that DESARVED it; and, in the
      meantime, an accommodation to my honest friend, my lord, your father,
      here. But, as fate would have it, you upset all by your progress INCOGNITO
      through them estates. Well, it's best as it is, and I am better pleased to
      be as we are, trusting all to a generous son's own heart. Now put the poor
      father out of pain, and tell us what you'll do, my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In one word, then,' said Lord Colambre, 'I will, upon two conditions,
      either join my father in levying fines to enable him to sell or mortgage
      whatever portion of his estate is necessary for the payment of these
      debts; or I will, in whatever other mode he can point out, as more
      agreeable or more advantageous to him, join in giving security to his
      creditors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear, noble fellow!' cried Sir Terence; 'none but an Irishman could do
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony, melted to tears, could not articulate, but held his arms
      open to embrace his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you have not heard my conditions yet,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, confound the conditions!' cried Sir Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What conditions could he ask that I could refuse at this minute?' said
      Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I&#8212;was it my heart's blood, and were I to be hanged for it,'
      cried Sir Terence. 'And what are the conditions?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That Mr. Garraghty shall be dismissed from the agency.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And welcome, and glad to get rid of him&#8212;the rogue, the tyrant,'
      said Lord Clonbrony; 'and, to be beforehand with you in your next wish,
      put Mr. Burke into his place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll write the letter for you to sign, my lord, this minute,' cried
      Terry, 'with all the pleasure in life. No; it's my Lord Colambre should do
      that in all justice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what's your next condition? I hope it's no worse,' said Lord
      Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That you and my mother should cease to be absentees.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh murder!' said Sir Terence; 'maybe that's not so easy; for there are
      two words to that bargain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony declared that, for his own part, he was ready to return to
      Ireland next morning, and to promise to reside on his estate all the rest
      of his days; that there was nothing he desired more, provided Lady
      Clonbrony would consent to it; but that he could not promise for her; that
      she was as obstinate as a mule on that point; that he had often tried, but
      that there was no moving her; and that, in short, he could not promise on
      her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was on this condition, Lord Colambre said, he must insist. Without
      this condition was granted, he would not engage to do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we must only see how it will be when she comes to town; she will
      come up from Buxton the day you're of age to sign some papers,' said Lord
      Clonbrony; 'but,' added he, with a very dejected look and voice, 'if all's
      to depend on my Lady Clonbrony's consenting to return to Ireland, I'm as
      far from all hope of being at ease as ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my conscience, we're all at sea again,' said Sir Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was silent: but in his silence there was such an air of
      firmness, that both Lord Clonbrony and Sir Terence were convinced
      entreaties would on this point be fruitless&#8212;Lord Clonbrony sighed
      deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But when it's ruin or safety, and her husband and all belonging to her at
      stake, the woman can't persist in being a mule,' said Sir Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of whom are you talking?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of whom? Oh, I beg your lordship's pardon&#8212;I thought I was talking
      to my lord; but, in other words, as you are her son, I'm persuaded her
      ladyship, your mother, will prove herself a reasonable woman&#8212;when
      she sees she can't help it. So, my Lord Clonbrony, cheer up; a great deal
      may be done by the fear of Mordicai, and an execution, especially now the
      prior creditor. Since there's no reserve between you and I now, my Lord
      Colambre,' said Sir Terence, 'I must tell you all, and how we shambled on
      those months while you were in Ireland. First, Mordicai went to law, to
      prove I was in a conspiracy with your father, pretending to be prior
      creditor, to keep him off and out of his own; which, after a world of
      swearing and law&#8212;-law always takes time to do justice, that's one
      comfort&#8212;the villain proved at last to be true enough, and so cast
      us; and I was forced to be paid off last week. So there's no prior
      creditor, or any shield of pretence that way. Then his execution was
      coming down upon us, and nothing to stay it till I thought of a monthly
      annuity to Mordicai, in the shape of a wager. So, the morning after he
      cast us, I went to him: "Mr. Mordicai," says I, "you must be PLASED to see
      a man you've beaten so handsomely; and though I'm sore, both for myself
      and my friend, yet you see I can laugh still; though an execution is no
      laughing matter, and I'm sinsible you've one in petto in your sleeve for
      my friend Lord Clonbrony. But I'll lay you a wager of a hundred guineas in
      paper that a marriage of his son with a certain heiress, before next
      Lady-day, will set all to rights, and pay you with a compliment too."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens, Sir Terence! surely you said no such thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did&#8212;but what was it but a wager? which is nothing but a dream;
      and, when lost, as I am as sinsible as you are that it must be, why, what
      is it, after all, but a bonus, in a gentleman-like form, to Mordicai?
      which, I grant you, is more than he deserves, for staying the execution
      till you be of age; and even for my Lady Clonbrony's sake, though I know
      she hates me like poison, rather than have her disturbed by an execution,
      I'd pay the hundred guineas this minute out of my own pocket, if I had' em
      in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A thundering knock at the door was heard at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never heed it; let 'em thunder,' said Sir Terence; 'whoever it is, they
      won't get in; for my lord bid them let none in for their life. It's
      necessary for us to be very particular about the street-door now; and I
      advise a double chain for it, and to have the footmen well tutored to look
      before they run to a double rap; for a double rap might be a double trap.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lady and Miss Nugent, my lord,' said a footman, throwing open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My mother! Miss Nugent!' cried Lord Colambre, springing eagerly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre! here!' said his mother; 'but it's all too late now, and no
      matter where you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony coldly suffered her son to embrace her; and he, without
      considering the coldness of her manner, scarcely hearing, and not at all
      understanding the words she said, fixed his eyes on his cousin, who, with
      a countenance all radiant with affectionate joy, held out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear cousin Colambre, what an unexpected pleasure!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the hand; but, as he was going to kiss it, the recollection of
      ST. OMAR crossed his mind; he checked himself, and said something about
      joy and pleasure, but his countenance expressed neither; and Miss Nugent,
      much surprised by the coldness of his manner, withdrew her hand, and,
      turning away, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace! darling!' called Lord Clonbrony, 'whither so fast, before you've
      given me a word or a kiss?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back, and hastily kissed her uncle, who folded her in his arms.
      'Why must I let you go? And what makes you so pale, my dear child?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am a little&#8212;a little tired. I will be with you again soon.' Her
      uncle let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your famous Buxton baths don't seem to have agreed with her, by all I can
      see,' said Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, the Buxton baths are no way to blame; but I know what is to
      blame, and who is to blame,' said Lady Clonbrony, in a tone of
      displeasure, fixing her eyes upon her son. 'Yes, you may well look
      confounded, Colambre; but it is too late now&#8212;you should have known
      your own mind in time. I see you have heard it, then&#8212;but I am sure I
      don't know how; for it was only decided the day I left Buxton. The news
      could hardly travel faster than I did. Pray, how did you hear it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hear what, ma'am?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, that Miss Broadhurst is going to be married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, is that all, ma'am!' said our hero, much relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All! Now, Lord Colambre, you REELLY are too much for my patience. But I
      flatter myself you will feel, when I tell you, that it is your friend, Sir
      Arthur Berryl, as I always prophesied, who has carried off the prize from
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But for the fear of displeasing my dear mother, I should say, that I do
      feel sincere pleasure in this marriage&#8212;I always wished it: my
      friend, Sir Arthur, from the first moment, trusted me with the secret of
      his attachment; he knew that he had my warm good wishes for his success;
      he knew that I thought most highly of the young lady; but that I never
      thought of her as a wife for myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why did not you? that is the very thing I complain of,' said Lady
      Clonbrony. 'But it is all over now. You may set your heart at ease, for
      they are to be married on Thursday; and poor Mrs. Broadhurst is ready to
      break her heart, for she was set upon a coronet for her daughter; and you,
      ungrateful as you are, you don't know how she wished you to be the happy
      man. But only conceive, after all that had passed, Miss Broadhurst had the
      assurance to expect I would let my niece be her bridesmaid. Oh, I flatly
      refused; that is, I told Grace it could not be; and, that there might be
      no affront to Mrs. Broadhurst, who did not deserve it, I pretended Grace
      had never mentioned it; but ordered my carriage, and left Buxton directly.
      Grace was hurt, for she is very warm in her friendships. I am sorry to
      hurt Grace. But REELLY I could not let her be bridesmaid;&#8212;and that,
      if you must know, is what vexed her, and made the tears come in her eyes,
      I suppose&#8212;and I'm sorry for it; but one must keep up one's dignity a
      little. After all, Miss Broadhurst was only a citizen&#8212;and REELLY
      now, a very odd girl; never did anything like anybody else; settled her
      marriage at last in the oddest way. Grace, can you tell the particulars? I
      own, I am tired of the subject, and tired of my journey. My lord, I shall
      take leave to dine in my own room to-day,' continued her ladyship, as she
      quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope her ladyship did not notice me,' said Sir Terence O'Fay, coming
      from behind a window-curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, Terry, what did you hide for?' said Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hide! I didn't hide, nor wouldn't from any man living, let alone any
      woman. [Leaving any woman out of the question.] Hide! no; but I just stood
      looking out of the window, behind this curtain, that my poor Lady
      Clonbrony might not be discomfited and shocked by the sight of one whom
      she can't abide, the very minute she come home. Oh, I've some
      consideration&#8212;it would have put her out of humour worse with both of
      you too; and for that there's no need, as far as I see. So I'll take
      myself off to my coffee-house to dine, and maybe you may get her down and
      into spirits again. But, for your lives, don't touch upon Ireland the
      night, nor till she has fairly got the better of the marriage. APROPOS&#8212;there's
      my wager to Mordicai gone at a slap. It's I that ought to be scolding you,
      my Lord Colambre; but I trust you will do as well yet, not in point of
      purse, maybe. But I'm not one of those that think that money's everything&#8212;though,
      I grant you, in this world, there's nothing to be had without it&#8212;love
      excepted&#8212;which most people don't believe in&#8212;but not I&#8212;in
      particular cases. So I leave you, with my blessing, and I've a notion, at
      this time, that is better than my company&#8212;your most devoted&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured Sir Terence would not be persuaded by Lord Clonbrony to
      stay. Nodding at Lord Colambre as he went out of the room, he said, 'I've
      an eye, in going, to your heart's ease too. When I played myself, I never
      liked standers-by.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence was not deficient in penetration, but he never could help
      boasting of his discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was grateful for his judicious departure; and followed his
      equally judicious advice, not to touch upon Ireland this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony was full of Buxton, and he was glad to be relieved from the
      necessity of talking; and he indulged himself in considering what might be
      passing in Miss Nugent's mind. She now appeared in remarkably good
      spirits; for her aunt had given her a hint that she thought her out of
      humour because she had not been permitted to be Miss Broadhurst's
      bridesmaid, and she was determined to exert herself to dispel this notion.
      This it was now easy for her to do, because she had, by this time, in her
      own imagination, found a plausible excuse for that coldness in Lord
      Colambre's reception of her, by which she had at first been hurt; she had
      settled it, that he had taken it for granted she was of his mother's
      sentiments respecting Miss Broadhurst's marriage, and that this idea, and
      perhaps the apprehension of her reproaches, had caused his embarrassment&#8212;she
      knew that she could easily set this misunderstanding right. Accordingly,
      when Lady Clonbrony had talked herself to sleep about Buxton, and was
      taking her afternoon's nap, as it was her custom to do when she had
      neither cards nor company to keep her awake, Miss Nugent began to explain
      her own sentiments, and to give Lord Colambre, as her aunt had desired, an
      account of the manner in which Miss Broadhurst's marriage had been
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the first place,' said she, 'let me assure you that I rejoice in this
      marriage; I think your friend, Sir Arthur Berryl, is every way deserving
      of my friend, Miss Broadhurst; and this from me,' said she, smiling, 'is
      no slight eulogium. I have marked the rise and progress of their
      attachment; and it has been founded on the perception of such excellent
      qualities on each side, that I have no fear for its permanence. Sir Arthur
      Berryl's honourable conduct in paying his father's debts, and his
      generosity to his mother and sisters, whose fortunes were left entirely
      dependent upon him, first pleased my friend. It was like what she would
      have done herself, and like&#8212;in short, it is what few young men, as
      she said, of the present day would do. Then his refraining from all
      personal expenses, his going without equipage and without horses, that he
      might do what he felt to be right, whilst it exposed him continually to
      the ridicule of fashionable young men, or to the charge of avarice, made a
      very different impression on Miss Broadhurst's mind; her esteem and
      admiration were excited by these proofs of strength of character, and of
      just and good principles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you go on, you will make me envious and jealous of my friend,' said
      Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You jealous!&#8212;Oh, it is too late now&#8212;besides, you cannot be
      jealous, for you never loved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never loved Miss Broadhurst, I acknowledge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was the advantage Sir Arthur Berryl had over you&#8212;he loved,
      and my friend saw it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was clear-sighted,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was clear-sighted,' repeated Miss Nugent; 'but if you mean that she
      was vain, and apt to fancy people in love with her, I can assure you that
      you are mistaken. Never was woman, young or old, more clear-sighted to the
      views of those by whom she was addressed. No flattery, no fashion, could
      blind her judgment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She knew how to choose a friend well, I am sure,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a friend for life too, I am sure you will allow and she had such
      numbers, such strange variety of admirers, as might have puzzled the
      choice and turned the brain of any inferior person. Such a succession of
      lovers as she has had this summer, ever since you went to Ireland&#8212;they
      appeared and vanished like figures in a magic-lantern. She had three noble
      admirers&#8212;rank in three different forms offered themselves. First
      came in, hobbling, rank and gout; next, rank and gaming; then rank, Very
      high rank, over head and ears in debt. All of these were rejected; and, as
      they moved off; I thought Mrs. Broadhurst would have broken her heart.
      Next came fashion, with his head, heart, and soul in his cravat&#8212;he
      quickly made his bow, or rather his nod, and walked off, taking a pinch of
      snuff. Then came a man of gallantry, but,' whispered Miss Nugent, 'there
      was a mistress in the wood; and my friend could have nothing to do with
      that gentleman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, if she liked the man, interrupted Lord Clonbrony, 'and I suppose she
      did, for all women, but yourself, Grace, like men of gallantry, Miss
      Broadhurst was a goose for refusing him on account of the mistress;
      because she might have been bought up, and settled with a few thousand
      pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be that as it may,' said Miss Nugent; 'my friend did not like, and would
      not accept, of the man of gallantry; so he retired and comforted himself
      with a copy of verses. Then came a man of wit&#8212;but still it was wit
      without worth; and presently came "worth without wit." She preferred "wit
      and worth united," which she fortunately at last found, Lord Colambre, in
      your friend, Sir Arthur Berryl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace, my girl!' said her uncle, 'I'm glad to see you've got up your
      spirits again, though you were not to be bridesmaid. Well, I hope you'll
      be bride soon&#8212;I'm sure you ought to be&#8212;and you should think of
      rewarding that poor Mr. Salisbury, who plagues me to death, whenever he
      can catch hold of me, about you. He must have our definitive at last, you
      know, Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence ensued, which neither Miss Nugent nor Lord Colambre seemed
      willing, or able, to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very good company, faith, you three!&#8212;One of ye asleep, and the other
      two saying nothing, to keep one awake. Colambre, have you no Dublin news?
      Grace, have you no Buxton scandal? What was it Lady Clonbrony told us
      you'd tell us, about the oddness of Miss Broadhurst's settling her
      marriage? Tell me that, for I love to hear odd things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you will not think it odd,' said she. 'One evening&#8212;but I
      should begin by telling you that three of her admirers, beside Sir Arthur
      Berryl, had followed her to Buxton, and had been paying their court to her
      all the time we were there; and at last grew impatient for her decision.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, for her definitive!' said Lord Clonbrony. Miss Nugent was put out
      again, but resumed&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'So one evening, just before the dancing began, the gentlemen were all
      standing round Miss Broadhurst; one of them said, "I wish Miss Broadhurst
      would decide&#8212;that whoever she dances with to-night should be her
      partner for life; what a happy man he would be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"But how can I decide?" said Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I wish I had a friend to plead for me!" said one of the suitors, looking
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Have you no friend of your own?" said Miss Broadhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Plenty of friends," said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Plenty!&#8212;then you must be a very happy man," replied Miss
      Broadhurst. "Come," said she, laughing, "I will dance with that man who
      can convince me&#8212;that he has, near relations excepted, one true
      friend in the world! That man who has made the best friend, I dare say,
      will make the best husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'At that moment,' continued Miss Nugent, 'I was certain who would be her
      choice. The gentlemen all declared at first that they had abundance of
      excellent friends the best friends in the world! but when Miss Broadhurst
      cross-examined them, as to what their friends had done for them, or what
      they were willing to do, modern friendship dwindled into a ridiculously
      small compass. I cannot give you the particulars of the cross-examination,
      though it was conducted with great spirit and humour by Miss Broadhurst;
      but I can tell you the result&#8212;that Sir Arthur Berryl, by
      incontrovertible facts, and eloquence warm from the heart, convinced
      everybody present that he had the best friend in the world; and Miss
      Broadhurst, as he finished speaking, gave him her hand, and he led her off
      in triumph&#8212;So you see, Lord Colambre, you were at last the cause of
      my friend's marriage!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Lord Colambre as she spoke these words, with such an
      affectionate smile, and such an expression of open, inmost tenderness in
      her whole countenance, that our hero could hardly resist the impulse of
      his passion&#8212;could hardly restrain himself from falling at her feet
      that instant, and declaring his love. 'But St. Omar! St. Omar!&#8212;It
      must not be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must be gone!' said Lord Clonbrony, pulling out his watch. 'It is time
      to go to my club; and poor Terry will wonder what has become of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre instantly offered to accompany his father; much to Lord
      Clonbrony's, and more to Miss Nugent's surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What!' said she to herself, 'after so long an absence, leave me!&#8212;Leave
      his mother, with whom he always used to stay&#8212;on purpose to avoid me!
      What can I have done to displease him? It is clear it was not about Miss
      Broadhurst's marriage he was offended; for he looked pleased, and like
      himself, whilst I was talking of that; but the moment afterwards, what a
      constrained, unintelligible expression of countenance and leaves me to go
      to a club which he detests!'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the gentlemen shut the door on leaving the room, Lady Clonbrony
      wakened, and, starting up, exclaimed&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter? Are they gone? Is Colambre gone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am, with my uncle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very odd! very odd of him to go and leave me! he always used to stay with
      me&#8212;what did he say about me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, I have nothing to say about him, or about anything, indeed,
      for I'm excessively tired and stupid&#8212;alone in London's as bad as
      anywhere else. Ring the bell, and we'll go to bed directly&#8212;if you
      have no objection, Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace made no objection; Lady Clonbrony went to bed and to sleep in ten
      minutes, Miss Nugent went to bed; but she lay awake, considering what
      could be the cause of her cousin Colambre's hard unkindness, and of 'his
      altered eye.' She was openness itself and she determined that, the first
      moment she could speak to him alone, she would at once ask for an
      explanation. With this resolution, she rose in the morning, and went down
      to the breakfast-room, in hopes of meeting him, as it had formerly been
      his custom to be early; and she expected to find him reading in his usual
      place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      No&#8212;Lord Colambre was not in his accustomed place, reading in the
      breakfast-room: nor did he make his appearance till both his father and
      mother had been some time at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning to you, my Lord Colambre,' said his mother, in a reproachful
      tone, the moment he entered; 'I am much obliged to you for your company
      last night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning to you, Colambre,' said his father, in a more jocose tone of
      reproach; 'I am obliged to you for your good company last night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning to you, Lord Colambre,' said Miss Nugent; and though she
      endeavoured to throw all reproach from her looks, and to let none be heard
      in her voice, yet there was a slight tremulous motion in that voice which
      struck our hero to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thank you, ma'am, for missing me,' said he, addressing himself to his
      mother; 'I stayed away but half an hour; I accompanied my father to St.
      James's Street, and when I returned I found that every one had retired to
      rest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, was that the case?' said Lady Clonbrony; 'I own I thought it very
      unlike you to leave me in that sort of way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And, lest you should be jealous of that half-hour when he was
      accompanying me,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'I must remark, that, though I had
      his body with me, I had none of his mind; that he left at home with you
      ladies, or with some fair one across the water, for the deuce of two words
      did he bestow upon me, with all his pretence of accompanying me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord Colambre seems to have a fair chance of a pleasant breakfast,' said
      Miss Nugent, smiling; 'reproaches on all sides.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have heard none on your side, Grace,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'and that's
      the reason, I suppose, he wisely takes his seat beside you. But, come, we
      will not badger you any more, my dear boy. We have given him as fine a
      complexion amongst us as if he had been out hunting these three hours;
      have not we, Grace?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When Colambre has been a season or two more in Lon'on, he'll not be so
      easily put out of countenance,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'you don't see young
      men of fashion here blushing about nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, nor about anything, my dear,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'but that's no
      proof they do nothing they ought to blush for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What they do, there's no occasion for ladies to inquire,' said Lady
      Clonbrony; 'but this I know, that it's a great disadvantage to a young man
      of a certain rank to blush; for no people, who live in a certain set, ever
      do; and it is the most opposite thing possible to a certain air, which, I
      own, I think Colambre wants; and now that he has done travelling in
      Ireland, which is no use in PINT of giving a gentleman a travelled air, or
      anything of that sort, I hope he will put himself under my conduct for
      next winter's campaign in town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony looked as if he did not know how to look; and, after
      drumming on the table for some seconds, said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre, I told you how it would be. That's a fatal hard condition of
      yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a hard condition, I hope, my dear father,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hard it must be, since it can't be fulfilled, or won't be fulfilled,
      which comes to the same thing,' replied Lord Clonbrony, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am persuaded, sir, that it will be fulfilled,' said Lord Colambre; 'I
      am persuaded that, when my mother hears the truth, and the whole truth&#8212;when
      she finds that your happiness, and the happiness of her whole family,
      depend upon her yielding her taste on one subject&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I see now what you are about,' cried Lady Clonbrony; 'you are coming
      round with your persuasions and prefaces to ask me to give up Lon'on, and
      go back with you to Ireland, my lord. You may save yourselves the trouble,
      all of you, for no earthly persuasions shall make me do it. I will never
      give up my taste on that PINT. My happiness has a right to be as much
      considered as your father's, Colambre, or anybody's; and, in one word, I
      won't do it,' cried she, rising angrily from the breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There! did not I tell you how it would be?' cried Lord Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My mother has not heard me, yet,' said Lord Colambre, laying his hand
      upon his mother's arm, as she attempted to pass; 'hear me, madam, for your
      own sake. You do not know what will happen, this very day&#8212;this very
      hour, perhaps&#8212;if you do not listen to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what will happen?' said Lady Clonbrony, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, indeed; she little knows,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'what's hanging over
      her head.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hanging over my head?' said Lady Clonbrony, looking up; 'nonsense! what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      An execution, madam!' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gracious me! an execution!' said Lady Clonbrony, sitting down again; 'but
      I heard you talk of an execution months ago, my lord, before my son went
      to Ireland, and it blew over I heard no more of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If won't blow over now,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'you'll hear more of it
      now. Sir Terence O'Fay it was, you may remember, that settled it then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, and can't he settle it now? Send for him, since he understands
      these cases; and I will ask him to dinner myself, for your sake, and be
      very civil to him, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All your civility, either for my sake or your own, will not signify a
      straw, my dear, in this case&#8212;anything that poor Terry could do, he'd
      do, and welcome, without it; but he can do nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing!&#8212;that's very extraordinary. But I'm clear no one dare to
      bring a real execution against us in earnest; and you are only trying to
      frighten me to your purpose, like a child; but it shan't do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, my dear; you'll see&#8212;too late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is it?&#8212;What is it?' cried Lord Clonbrony, growing very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre changed colour too, and ran downstairs. 'Don't let 'em let
      anybody in, for your life, Colambre; under any pretence,' cried Lord
      Clonbrony, calling from the head of the stairs; then running to the
      window, 'By all that's good, it's Mordicai himself! and the people with
      him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lean your head on me, my dear aunt,' said Miss Nugent. Lady Clonbrony
      leant back, trembling, and ready to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he's walking off now; the rascal could not get in&#8212;safe for the
      present!' cried Lord Clonbrony, rubbing his hands, and repeating, 'safe
      for the present!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Safe for the present!' repeated Lord Colambre, coming again into the
      room. 'Safe for the present hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He could not get in, I suppose&#8212;oh, I warned all the servants well,'
      said Lord Clonbrony,' and so did Terry. Ay, there's the rascal, Mordicai,
      walking off, at the end of the street; I know his walk a mile off. Gad! I
      can breathe again. I am glad he's gone. But he will come back and always
      lie in wait, and some time or other, when we're off our guard (unawares),
      he'll slide in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Slide in! Oh, horrid!' cried Lady Clonbrony, sitting up, and wiping away
      the water which Miss Nugent had sprinkled on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Were you much alarmed?' said Lord Colambre, with a voice of tenderness,
      looking at his mother first, but his eyes fixing on Miss Nugent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shockingly!' said Lady Clonbrony; 'I never thought it would REELLY come
      to this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will really come to much more, my dear,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'that
      you may depend upon, unless you prevent it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord! what can I do?&#8212;I know nothing of business; how should I, Lord
      Clonbrony; but I know there's Colambre&#8212;I was always told that when
      he was of age everything should be settled; and why can't he settle it
      when he's upon the spot?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And upon one condition, I will,' cried Lord Colambre; 'at what loss to
      myself, my dear mother, I need not mention.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I will mention it,' cried Lord Clonbrony; 'at the loss it will be of
      nearly half the estate he would have had, if we had not spent it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Loss! Oh, I am excessively sorry my son's to be at such a loss&#8212;it
      must not be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It cannot be otherwise,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'nor it can't be this way
      either, my Lady Clonbrony, unless you comply with his condition, and
      consent to return to Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot&#8212;I will not,' replied Lady Clonbrony. 'Is this your
      condition, Colambre?&#8212;I take it exceedingly ill of you. I think it
      very unkind, and unhandsome, and ungenerous, and undutiful of you,
      Colambre; you, my son!' She poured forth a torrent of reproaches; then
      came to entreaties and tears. But our hero, prepared for this, had steeled
      his mind; and he stood resolved not to indulge his own feelings, or to
      yield to caprice or persuasion, but to do that which he knew was best for
      the happiness of hundreds of tenants who depended upon them&#8212;best for
      both his father and his mother's ultimate happiness and respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all in vain,' cried Lord Clonbrony; 'I have no resource but one, and
      I must condescend now to go to him this minute, for Mordicai will be back
      and seize all&#8212;I must sign and leave all to Garraghty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sign, sign, my lord, and settle with Garraghty.&#8212;Colambre,
      I've heard all the complaints you brought over against that man. My lord
      spent half the night telling them to me; but all agents are bad, I
      suppose; at any rate I can't help it&#8212;sign, sign, my lord; he has
      money&#8212;yes, do; go and settle with him, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre and Miss Nugent, at one and the same moment, stopped Lord
      Clonbrony as he was quitting the room, and then approached Lady Clonbrony
      with supplicating looks; but she turned her head to the other side, and,
      as if putting away their entreaties, made a repelling motion with both her
      hands, and exclaimed, 'No, Grace Nugent!&#8212;no, Colambre&#8212;no&#8212;no,
      Colambre! I'll never hear of leaving Lon'on&#8212;there's no living out of
      Lon'on&#8212;I can't, I won't live out of Lon'on, I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son saw that the LONDONOMANIA was now stronger than ever upon her, but
      resolved to make one desperate appeal to her natural feelings, which,
      though smothered, he could not believe were wholly extinguished; he caught
      her repelling hands, and pressing them with respectful tenderness to his
      lips&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear mother, you once loved your son,' said he; 'loved him better
      than anything in this world; if one spark of affection for him remains,
      hear him now, and forgive him, if he pass the bounds&#8212;bounds he never
      passed before of filial duty. Mother, in compliance with your wishes my
      father left Ireland&#8212;left his home, his duties, his friends, his
      natural connexions, and for many years he has lived in England, and you
      have spent many seasons in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, in the very best company&#8212;in the very first circles,' said Lady
      Clonbrony; 'cold as the high-bred English are said to be in general to
      strangers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' replied Lord Colambre; 'the very best company (if you mean the most
      fashionable) have accepted of our entertainments. We have forced our way
      into their frozen circles; we have been permitted to breathe in these
      elevated regions of fashion; we have it to say, that the duke of this, and
      my lady that, are of our acquaintance. We may say more; we may boast that
      we have vied with those whom we could never equal. And at what expense
      have we done all this? For a single season, the last winter (I will go no
      farther), at the expense of a great part of your timber, the growth of a
      century&#8212;swallowed in the entertainments of one winter in London! Our
      hills to be bare for another half century to come! But let the trees go; I
      think more of your tenants&#8212;of those left under the tyranny of a bad
      agent, at the expense of every comfort, every hope they enjoyed!&#8212;tenants,
      who were thriving and prosperous; who used to smile upon you, and to bless
      you both! In one cottage, I have seen&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Lord Clonbrony, unable to restrain his emotion, hurried out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I am sure it is not my fault,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'for I brought
      my lord a large fortune; and I am confident I have not, after all, spent
      more any season, in the best company, than he has among a set of low
      people, in his muddling, discreditable way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And how has he been reduced to this?' said Lord Colambre. 'Did he not
      formerly live with gentlemen, his equals, in his own country; his
      contemporaries? Men of the first station and character, whom I met in
      Dublin, spoke of him in a manner that gratified the heart of his son; he
      was respectable and respected at his own home; but when he was forced away
      from that home, deprived of his objects, his occupations induced him to
      live in London, or at watering-places, where he could find no employments
      that were suitable to him&#8212;set down, late in life, in the midst of
      strangers, to him cold and reserved&#8212;himself too proud to bend to
      those who disdained him as an Irishman&#8212;is he not more to be pitied
      than blamed for&#8212;yes, I, his son, must say the word&#8212;the
      degradation which has ensued? And do not the feelings, which have this
      moment forced him to leave the room, show that he is capable?&#8212;Oh,
      mother!' cried Lord Colambre, throwing himself at Lady Clonbrony's feet,
      'restore my father to himself! Should such feelings be wasted?&#8212;No;
      give them again to expand in benevolent, in kind, useful actions; give him
      again to his tenantry, his duties, his country, his home; return to that
      home yourself, dear mother! leave all the nonsense of high life&#8212;scorn
      the impertinence of these dictators of fashion, by whom, in return for all
      the pains we take to imitate, to court them&#8212;in return for the
      sacrifice of health, fortune, peace of mind, they bestow sarcasm,
      contempt, ridicule, and mimickry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Colambre! Colambre! mimickry&#8212;I'll never believe it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Believe me&#8212;believe me, mother; for I speak of what I know. Scorn
      them&#8212;quit them! Return to an unsophisticated people&#8212;to poor,
      but grateful hearts, still warm with the remembrance of your kindness,
      still blessing you for favours long since conferred, ever praying to see
      you once more. Believe me, for I speak of what I know&#8212;your son has
      heard these prayers, has felt these blessings. Here! at my heart felt, and
      still feel them, when I was not known to be your son, in the cottage of
      the widow O'Neill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, did you see the widow O'Neill? and does she remember me?' said Lady
      Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Remember you! and you, Miss Nugent! I have slept in the bed&#8212;I would
      tell you more, but I cannot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well! I never should have thought they would have remembered me so long!&#8212;poor
      people!' said Lady Clonbrony. 'I thought all in Ireland must have
      forgotten me, it is now so long since I was at home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not forgotten in Ireland by any rank, I can answer for that.
      Return home, my dearest mother&#8212;let me see you once more among your
      natural friends, beloved, respected, happy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, return! let us return home!' cried Miss Nugent, with a voice of great
      emotion. 'Return, let us return home! My beloved aunt, speak to us! say
      that you grant our request!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She kneeled beside Lord Colambre, as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it possible to resist that voice&#8212;that look?' thought Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If anybody knew,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'if anybody could conceive, how I
      detest the sight, the thoughts of that old yellow damask furniture, in the
      drawing-room at Clonbrony Castle&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens!' cried Lord Colambre, starting up, and looking at his
      mother in stupefied astonishment; 'is THAT what you are thinking of,
      ma'am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The yellow damask furniture!' said her niece, smiling. Oh, if that's all,
      that shall never offend your eyes again. Aunt, my painted velvet chairs
      are finished; and trust the furnishing that room to me. The legacy lately
      left me cannot be better applied you shall see how beautifully it will be
      furnished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, if I had money, I should like to do it myself; but it would take an
      immensity to new furnish Clonbrony Castle properly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The furniture in this house,' said Miss Nugent, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would do a great deal towards it, I declare,' cried Lady Clonbrony; 'that
      never struck me before, Grace, I protest&#8212;and what would not suit one
      might sell or exchange here&#8212;and it would be a great amusement to me&#8212;and
      I should like to set the fashion of something better in that country. And
      I declare, now, I should like to see those poor people, and that widow
      O'Neill. I do assure you, I think I was happier at home; only, that one
      gets, I don't know how, a notion, one's nobody out of Lon'on. But, after
      all, there's many drawbacks in Lon'on&#8212;and many people are very
      impertinent, I'll allow&#8212;and if there's a woman in the world I hate,
      it is Mrs. Dareville&#8212;and, if I was leaving Lon'on, I should not
      regret Lady Langdale neither&#8212;and Lady St. James is as cold as a
      stone. Colambre may well say FROZEN CIRCLES&#8212;these sort of people are
      really very cold, and have, I do believe, no hearts. I don't verily think
      there is one of them would regret me more&#8212;Hey! let me see, Dublin&#8212;the
      winter Merrion Square&#8212;new furnished&#8212;and the summer&#8212;Clonbrony
      Castle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre and Miss Nugent waited in silence till her mind should have
      worked itself clear. One great obstacle had been removed; and now that the
      yellow damask had been taken out of her imagination, they no longer
      despaired. Lord Clonbrony put his head into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What hopes?&#8212;any? if not, let me go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the doubting expression of Lady Clonbrony's countenance&#8212;hope
      in the face of his son and niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, dear Lady Clonbrony, make us all happy by one word,' said he,
      kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You never kissed me so since we left Ireland before,' said Lady
      Clonbrony. 'Well, since it must be so, let us go,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did I ever see such joy!' said Lord Clonbrony, clasping his hands; 'I
      never expected such joy in my life!&#8212;I must go and tell poor Terry!'
      and off he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now, since we are to go,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'pray let us go
      immediately, before the thing gets wind, else I shall have Mrs. Dareville,
      and Lady Langdale, and Lady St. James, and all the world, coming to
      condole with me, just to satisfy their own curiosity; and then Miss Pratt,
      who hears everything that everybody says, and more than they say, will
      come and tell me how it is reported everywhere that we are ruined. 'Oh! I
      never could bear to stay and hear all this. I'll tell you what I'll do&#8212;you
      are to be of age the day after to-morrow, Colambre&#8212;very well, there
      are some papers for me to sign&#8212;I must stay to put my name to them,
      and that done, that minute I'll leave you and Lord Clonbrony to settle all
      the rest; and I'll get into my carriage with Grace, and go down to Buxton
      again; where you can come for me, and take me up, when you're all ready to
      go to Ireland&#8212;and we shall be so far on our way. Colambre, what do
      you say to this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That&#8212;if you like it, madam,' said he, giving one hasty glance at
      Miss Nugent, and withdrawing his eyes, 'it is the best possible
      arrangement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So,' thought Grace, 'that is the best possible arrangement which takes us
      away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I like it!' said Lady Clonbrony; 'to be sure I do, or I should not
      propose it. What is Colambre thinking of? I know, Grace, at all events,
      what you and I must think of&#8212;of having the furniture packed up, and
      settling what's to go, and what's to be exchanged, and all that. Now, my
      dear, go and write a note directly to Mr. Soho, and bid him come himself,
      immediately; and we'll go and make out a catalogue this instant of what
      furniture I will have packed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with her head full of furniture, Lady Clonbrony retired. 'I go to my
      business, Colambre; and I leave you to settle yours in peace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In peace!&#8212;Never was our hero's mind less at peace than at this
      moment. The more his heart felt that it was painful, the more his reason
      told him it was necessary that he should part from Grace Nugent. To his
      union with her there was an obstacle, which his prudence told him ought to
      be insurmountable; yet he felt that, during the few days he had been with
      her, the few hours he had been near her, he had, with his utmost power
      over himself, scarcely been master of his passion, or capable of
      concealing it from its object. It could not have been done but for her
      perfect simplicity and innocence. But how could this be supposed on his
      part? How could he venture to live with this charming girl? How could he
      settle at home? What resource?
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind turned towards the army; he thought that abroad, and in active
      life, he should lose all the painful recollections, and drive from his
      heart all the resentments, which could now be only a source of unavailing
      regret. But his mother&#8212;his mother, who had now yielded her own taste
      to his entreaties, for the good of her family&#8212;she expected him to
      return and live with her in Ireland. Though not actually promised or
      specified, he knew that she took it for granted; that it was upon this
      hope, this faith, she consented; he knew that she would be shocked at the
      bare idea of his going into the army. There was one chance&#8212;our hero
      tried, at this moment, to think it the best possible chance&#8212;that
      Miss Nugent might marry Mr. Salisbury, and settle in England. On this idea
      he relied as the only means of extricating him from difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to turn his thoughts immediately to business, to execute
      his promises to his father. Two great objects were now to be accomplished&#8212;the
      payment of his father's debts, and the settlement of the Irish agent's
      accounts; and, in transacting this complicated business, he derived
      considerable assistance from Sir Terence O'Fay, and from Sir Arthur
      Berryl's solicitor, Mr. Edwards. Whilst acting for Sir Arthur, on a former
      occasion, Lord Colambre had gained the entire confidence of this
      solicitor, who was a man of the first eminence. Mr. Edwards took the
      papers and Lord Clonbrony's title-deeds home with him, saying that he
      would give an answer the next morning. He then waited upon Lord Colambre,
      and informed him, that he had just received a letter from Sir Arthur
      Berryl, who, with the consent and desire of his lady, requested that
      whatever money might be required by Lord Clonbrony should be immediately
      supplied on their account, without waiting till Lord Colambre should be of
      age, as the ready money might be of same convenience to him in
      accelerating the journey to Ireland, which Sir Arthur and Lady Berryl knew
      was his lordship's object. Sir Terence O'Fay now supplied Mr. Edwards with
      accurate information as to the demands that were made upon Lord Clonbrony,
      and of the respective characters of the creditors. Mr. Edwards undertook
      to settle with the fair claimants; Sir Terence with the rogues; so that by
      the advancement of ready money from THE BERRYLS, and by the detection of
      false and exaggerated charges, which Sir Terence made among the inferior
      class, the debts were reduced nearly to one half of their former amount.
      Mordicai, who had been foiled in his vile attempt to become sole creditor,
      had, however, a demand of more than seven thousand pounds upon Lord
      Clonbrony, which he had raised to this enormous sum in six or seven years,
      by means well known to himself. He stood the foremost in the list, not
      from the greatness of the sum, but from the danger of his adding to it the
      expenses of law. Sir Terence undertook to pay the whole with five thousand
      pounds. Lord Clonbrony thought it impossible; the solicitor thought it
      improvident, because he knew that upon a trial a much greater abatement
      would be allowed; but Lord Colambre was determined, from the present
      embarrassments of his own situation, to leave nothing undone that could be
      accomplished immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Terence, pleased with his commission, immediately went to Mordicai.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Sir Terence,' said Mordicai, 'I hope you are come to pay me my
      hundred guineas; for Miss Broadhurst is married!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Mister Mordicai, what then? The ides of March are come, but not
      gone! Stay, if you plase, Mister Mordicai, till Lady-day, when it becomes
      due; in the meantime, I have a handful, or rather an armful, of bank-notes
      for you, from my Lord Colambre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Humph!' said Mordicai; 'how's that? he'll not be of age these three
      days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't matter for that; he has sent me to look over your account, and to
      hope that you will make some small ABATEMENT in the total.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Harkee, Sir Terence you think yourself very clever in things of this
      sort, but you've mistaken your man; I have an execution for the whole, and
      I'll be d&#8212;d if all your cunning shall MAKE me take up with part!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be easy, Mister Mordicai!&#8212;you shan't make me break your bones, nor
      make me drop one actionable word against your high character; for I know
      your clerk there, with that long goose-quill behind his ear, would be
      ready evidence again' me. But I beg to know, in one word, whether you will
      take five thousand down, and GIVE Lord Clonbrony a discharge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Mr. Terence! nor six thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine pounds. My
      demand is L7130, odd shillings: if you have that money, pay it; if not, I
      know how to get it, and along with it complete revenge for all the insults
      I have received from that greenhorn, his son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Paddy Brady!' cried Sir Terence, 'do you hear that? Remember that word,
      REVENGE!&#8212;Mind, I call you to witness!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, sir, will you raise a rebellion among my workmen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Mr. Mordicai, no rebellion; and I hope you won't cut the boy's ears
      off for listening to a little of the brogue&#8212;So listen, my good lad.
      Now, Mr. Mordicai, I offer you here, before little goose-quill, L5000
      ready penny&#8212;take it, or leave it; take your money, and leave your
      revenge; or, take your revenge, and lose your money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir Terence, I value neither your threats nor your cunning. Good morning
      to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning to you, Mr. Mordicai&#8212;but not kindly! Mr. Edwards, the
      solicitor, has been at the office to take off the execution; so now you
      may have law to your heart's content! And it was only to plase the young
      lord that the OULD one consented to my carrying this bundle to you,'&#8212;showing
      the bank-notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Edwards employed!' cried Mordicai. 'Why, how the devil did Lord
      Clonbrony get into such hands as his? The execution taken off! Well, sir,
      go to law I am ready for you; Jack Latitat is A MATCH for your sober
      solicitor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning again to you, Mr. Mordicai; we're fairly out of your
      clutches, and we have enough to do with our money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Sir Terence, I must allow you have a very wheedling way&#8212;Here,
      Mr. Thompson, make out a receipt for Lord Clonbrony: I never go to law
      with an old customer, if I can help it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This business settled, Mr. Soho was next to be dealt with.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at Lady Clonbrony's summons; and was taking directions, with the
      utmost SANG FROID, for packing up and sending off the very furniture for
      which he was not paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre called him into his father's study; and, producing his bill,
      he began to point out various articles which were charged at prices that
      were obviously extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, really, my lord, they are ABUNDANTLY extravagant; if I charged
      vulgar prices, I should be only a vulgar tradesman. I, however, am not a
      broker, nor a Jew. Of the article superintendence, which is only L500, I
      cannot abate a dolt; on the rest of the bill, if you mean to offer READY,
      I mean, without any negotiation, to abate thirty per cent; and I hope that
      is a fair and gentlemanly offer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Soho, there is your money!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord Colambre! I would give the contents of three such bills to be
      sure of such noblemanly conduct as yours. Lady Clonbrony's furniture shall
      be safely packed, without costing her a farthing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of Mr. Edwards, the solicitor, every other claim was soon
      settled; and Lord Clonbrony, for the first time since he left Ireland,
      found himself out of debt, and out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nick's account could not be settled in London. Lord Colambre had
      detected numerous false charges, and sundry impositions; the land, which
      had been purposely let to run wild, so far from yielding any rent, was
      made a source of constant expense, as remaining still unset: this was a
      large tract, for which St. Dennis had at length offered a small rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a fair calculation of the profits of the ground, and from other items
      in the account, Nicholas Garraghty, Esq., appeared at last to be, not the
      creditor, but the debtor to Lord Clonbrony. He was dismissed with
      disgrace, which perhaps he might not have felt, if it had not been
      accompanied by pecuniary loss, and followed by the fear of losing his
      other agencies, and by the dread of immediate bankruptcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burke was appointed agent in his stead to the Clonbrony as well as the
      Colambre estate. His appointment was announced to him by the following
      letter:&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      To MRS. BURKE, AT COLAMBRE. DEAR MADAM, The traveller whom you so
      hospitably received some months ago was Lord Colambre&#8212;he now writes
      to you in his proper person. He promised you that he would, as far as it
      might be in his power, do justice to Mr. Burke's conduct and character, by
      representing what he had done for Lord Clonbrony in the town of Colambre,
      and in the whole management of the tenantry and property under his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for my father, my dear madam, he is now as fully convinced as you
      could wish him to be of Mr. Burke's merits; and he begs me to express his
      sense of the obligations he is under to him and to you. He entreats that
      you will pardon the impropriety of a letter, which, as I assured you the
      moment I saw it, he never wrote or read. This will, he says, cure him, for
      life, of putting his signature to any paper without reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hopes that you will forget that such a letter was ever received, and
      that you will use your influence with Mr. Burke to induce him to continue
      to our family his regard and valuable services. Lord Clonbrony encloses a
      power of attorney, enabling Mr. Burke to act in future for him, if Mr.
      Burke will do him that favour, in managing the Clonbrony as well as the
      Colambre estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony will be in Ireland in the course of next month, and intends
      to have the pleasure of soon paying his respects in person to Mr. Burke,
      at Colambre.&#8212;I am, dear madam, your obliged guest, and faithful
      servant, COLAMBRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      GROSVENOR SQUARE, LONDON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was so continually occupied with business during the two
      days previous to his coming of age, every morning at his solicitor's
      chambers, every evening in his father's study, that Miss Nugent never saw
      him but at breakfast or dinner; and, though she watched for it most
      anxiously, never could find an opportunity of speaking to him alone, or of
      asking an explanation of the change and inconsistencies of his manner. At
      last, she began to think that, in the midst of so much business of
      importance, by which he seemed harassed, she should do wrong to torment
      him, by speaking of any small disquietude that concerned only herself. She
      determined to suppress her doubts, to keep her feelings to herself, and to
      endeavour, by constant kindness, to regain that place in his affections
      which she imagined that she had lost. 'Everything will go right again,'
      thought she, 'and we shall all be happy, when he returns with us to
      Ireland&#8212;to that dear home which he loves as well as I do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The day Lord Colambre was of age, the first thing he did was to sign a
      bond for five thousand pounds, Miss Nugent's fortune, which had been lent
      to his father, who was her guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This, sir, I believe,' said he, giving it to his father as soon as signed&#8212;'this,
      I believe, is the first debt you would wish to have secured.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well thought of, my dear boy I&#8212;God bless you!&#8212;that has
      weighed more upon my conscience and heart than all the rest, though I
      never said anything about it. I used, whenever I met Mr. Salisbury, to
      wish myself fairly down at the centre of the earth; not that he ever
      thought of fortune, I'm sure; for he often told me, and I believed him, he
      would rather have Miss Nugent without a penny, if he could get her, than
      the first fortune in the empire. But I'm glad she will not go to him
      penniless, for all that; and by my fault, especially. There, there's my
      name to it&#8212;do witness it, Terry. But, Colambre, you must give it to
      her&#8212;you must take it to Grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Excuse me, sir; it is no gift of mine&#8212;it is a debt of yours. I beg
      you will take the bond to her yourself, my dear father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear son, you must not always have your own way, and hide everything
      good you do, or give me the honour of it. I won't be the jay in borrowed
      feathers. I have borrowed enough in my life, and I've done with borrowing
      now, thanks to you, Colambre&#8212;so come along with me; for I'll be
      hanged if ever I give this joint bond to Miss Nugent, without you along
      with me. Leave Lady Clonbrony here to sign these papers. Terry will
      witness them properly, and you come along with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And pray, my lord,' said her ladyship, 'order the carriage to the door;
      for, as soon as you have my signature, I hope you'll let me off to
      Buxton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, certainly&#8212;the carriage is ordered&#8212;everything ready, my
      dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And pray tell Grace to be ready,' added Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not necessary; for she is always ready,' said Lord Clonbrony.
      'Come, Colambre,' added he, taking his son under the arm, and carrying him
      up to Miss Nugent's dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knocked, and were admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ready!' said Lord Clonbrony; 'ay, always ready&#8212;so I said. Here's
      Colambre, my darling,' continued he, 'has secured your fortune to you to
      my heart's content; but he would not condescend to come up to tell you so,
      till I made him. Here's the bond; put your hand to it, Colambre; you were
      ready enough to do that when it cost you something; and now, all I have to
      ask of you is, to persuade her to marry out of hand, that I may see her
      happy before I die. Now my heart's at ease! I can meet Mr. Salisbury with
      a safe conscience. One kiss, my little Grace. If anybody can persuade you,
      I'm sure it's that man that's now leaning against the mantelpiece. It's
      Colambre's will, or your heart's not made like mine&#8212;so I leave you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And out of the room walked he, leaving his poor son in as awkward,
      embarrassing, and painful a situation, as could well be conceived. Half a
      dozen indistinct ideas crossed his mind; quick conflicting feelings made
      his heart beat and stop. And how it would have ended, if he had been left
      to himself, whether he would have stood or fallen, have spoken or have
      continued silent, can never now be known, for all was decided without the
      action of his will. He was awakened from his trance by these simple words
      from Miss Nugent&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm much obliged to you, cousin Colambre&#8212;more obliged to you for
      your kindness in thinking of me first, in the midst of all your other
      business, than by your securing my fortune. Friendship&#8212;and your
      friendship&#8212;is worth more to me than fortune. May I believe that is
      secured?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Believe it! Oh, Grace, can you doubt it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not; it would make me too unhappy. I will not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is enough&#8212;I am satisfied&#8212;I ask no farther explanation.
      You are truth itself&#8212;one word from you is security sufficient. We
      are friends for life,' said she, taking his hand between both of hers;
      'are not we?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are&#8212;and therefore sit down, cousin Grace, and let me claim the
      privilege of friendship, and speak to you of him who aspires to be more
      than your friend for life, Mr.&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Salisbury!' said Miss Nugent; 'I saw him yesterday. We had a very long
      conversation; I believe he understands my sentiments perfectly, and that
      he no longer thinks of being more to me than a friend for life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have refused him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I have a high opinion of Mr. Salisbury's understanding, a great
      esteem for his character; I like his manners and conversation; but I do
      not love him, and therefore, you know, I could not marry him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Miss Nugent, with a high opinion, a great esteem, and liking
      his manners and conversation, in such a well-regulated mind as yours, can
      there be a better foundation for love?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is an excellent foundation,' said she; 'but I never went any farther
      than the foundation; and, indeed, I never wished to proceed any farther.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre scarcely dared to ask why; but, after some pause, he said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't wish to intrude upon your confidence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You cannot intrude upon my confidence; I am ready to give it to you
      entirely, frankly; I hesitated only because another person was concerned.
      Do you remember, at my aunt's gala, a lady who danced with Mr. Salisbury?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not in the least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lady with whom you and Mr. Salisbury were talking, just before supper,
      in the Turkish tent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not in the least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As we went down to supper, you told me you had had a delightful
      conversation with her&#8212;that you thought her a charming woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A charming woman!&#8212;I have not the slightest recollection of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you told me that she and Mr. Salisbury had been praising me A L'ENVIE
      L'UNE ET L'AUTRE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I recollect her now perfectly,' said Lord Colambre; 'But what of
      her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is the woman who, I hope, will be Mrs. Salisbury. Ever since I have
      been acquainted with them both, I have seen that they were suited to each
      other; and fancy, indeed I am almost sure, that she could love him,
      tenderly love him&#8212;and, I know, I could not. But my own sentiments,
      you may be sure, are all I ever told Mr. Salisbury.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But of your own sentiments you may not be sure,' said Lord Colambre; 'and
      I see no reason why you should give him up from false generosity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Generosity?' interrupted Miss Nugent; 'you totally misunderstand me;
      there is no generosity, nothing for me to give up in the case. I did not
      refuse Mr. Salisbury from generosity, but because I did not love him.
      Perhaps my seeing this at first prevented me from thinking of him as a
      lover; but, from whatever cause, I certainly never felt love for Mr.
      Salisbury, nor any of that pity which is said to lead to love; perhaps,'
      added she, smiling, 'because I was aware that he would be so much better
      off after I refused him&#8212;so much happier with one suited to him in
      age, talents, fortune, and love&#8212;"What bliss, did he but know his
      bliss," were HIS!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he but know his bliss,' repeated Lord Colambre; 'but is not he the
      best judge of his own bliss?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And am not I the best judge of mine?' said Miss Nugent; 'I go no
      farther.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are; and I have no right to go farther. Yet, this much permit me to
      say, my dear Grace, that it would give me sincere pleasure, that is, real
      satisfaction, to see you happily&#8212;established.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, my dear Lord Colambre; but you spoke that like a man of
      seventy at least, with the most solemn gravity of demeanour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I meant to be serious, not solemn,' said Lord Colambre, endeavouring to
      change his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There now,' said she, in a playful tone, 'you have SERIOUSLY accomplished
      the task my good uncle set you; so I will report well of you to him, and
      certify that you did all that in you lay to exhort me to marry; that you
      have even assured me that it would give you sincere pleasure, that is,
      real satisfaction, to see me happily established.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Grace, if you knew how much I felt when I said that, you would spare
      this raillery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will be serious&#8212;I am most seriously convinced of the sincerity of
      your affection for me; I know my happiness is your object in all you have
      said, and I thank you from my heart for the interest you take about me.
      But really and truly, I do not wish to marry. This is not a mere
      commonplace speech; but I have not yet seen any man I could love. I like
      you, cousin Colambre, better than Mr. Salisbury&#8212;I would rather live
      with you than with him; you know that is a certain proof that I am not
      likely to be in love with him. I am happy as I am, especially now we are
      all going to dear Ireland, home, to live together: you cannot conceive
      with what pleasure I look forward to that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was not vain; but love quickly sees love where it exists, or
      foresees the probability, the possibility of its existence. He saw that
      Miss Nugent might love him tenderly, passionately; but that duty, habit,
      the prepossession that it was impossible she could marry her cousin
      Colambre&#8212;a prepossession instilled into her by his mother&#8212;had
      absolutely prevented her from ever yet thinking of him as a lover. He saw
      the hazard for her, he felt the danger for himself. Never had she appeared
      to him so attractive as at this moment, when he felt the hope that he
      could obtain return of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But St. Omar!&#8212;Why! why is she a St, Omar!&#8212;illegitimate!&#8212;"No
      St. Omar SANS REPROCHE." My wife she cannot be&#8212;I will not engage her
      affections.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift as thoughts in moments of strong feeling pass in the mind without
      being put into words, our hero thought all this, and determined, cost what
      it would, to act honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You spoke of my returning to Ireland, my dear Grace. I have not yet told
      you my plans.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Plans! are not you returning with us?' said she, precipitately; 'are not
      you going to Ireland&#8212;home&#8212;with us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&#8212;I am going to serve a campaign or two abroad. I think every
      young man in these times&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens! What does this mean? What can you mean?' cried she, fixing
      her eyes upon his, as if she would read his very soul. 'Why? what reason?&#8212;Oh,
      tell me the truth and at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His change of colour&#8212;his hand that trembled, and withdrew from hers&#8212;the
      expression of his eyes as they met hers&#8212;revealed the truth to her at
      once. As it flashed across her mind, she started back; her face grew
      crimson, and, in the same instant, pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&#8212;you see, you feel the truth now,' said Lord Colambre. 'You see,
      you feel, that I love you&#8212;passionately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, let me not hear it!' said she; 'I must not&#8212;ought not. Never,
      till this moment, did such a thought cross my mind&#8212;I thought it
      impossible&#8212;oh, make me think so still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will&#8212;it is impossible that we can ever be united.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always thought so,' said she, taking breath with a deep sigh. 'Then why
      not live as we have lived?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot&#8212;I cannot answer for myself&#8212;I will not run the risk;
      and therefore I must quit you&#8212;knowing, as I do, that there is an
      invincible obstacle to our union, of what nature I cannot explain; I beg
      you not to inquire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You need not beg it&#8212;I shall not inquire&#8212;I have no curiosity&#8212;none,'
      said she, in a passive, dejected tone; 'that is not what I am thinking of
      in the least. I know there are invincible obstacles; I wish it to be so.
      But, if invincible, you who have so much sense, honour, and virtue&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope, my dear cousin, that I have honour and virtue. But there are
      temptations to which no wise, no good man will expose himself. Innocent
      creature! you do not know the power of love. I rejoice that you have
      always thought it impossible&#8212;think so still&#8212;it will save you
      from&#8212;all I must endure. Think of me but as your cousin, your friend&#8212;give
      your heart to some happier man. As your friend, your true friend, I
      conjure you, give your heart to some more fortunate man. Marry, if you can
      feel love&#8212;marry, and be happy. Honour! virtue! Yes, I have both, and
      I will not forfeit them. Yes, I will merit your esteem and my own&#8212;by
      actions, not words; and I give you the strongest proof, by tearing myself
      from you at this moment. Farewell!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The carriage at the door, Miss Nugent, and my lady calling for you,' said
      her maid. 'Here's your key, ma'am, and here's your gloves, my dear ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The carriage at the door, Miss Nugent,' said Lady Clonbrony's woman,
      coming eagerly with parcels in her hand, as Miss Nugent passed her and ran
      downstairs; 'and I don't know where I laid my lady's NUMBRELLA, for my
      life&#8212;do your Anne?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed&#8212;but I know here's my own young lady's watch that she has
      left. Bless me! I never knew her to forget anything on a journey before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she is going to be married, as sure as my name's Le Maistre, and to
      my Lord Colambre; for he has been here this hour, to my certain Bible
      knowledge. Oh, you'll see, she will be Lady Colambre!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish she may, with all my heart' said Anne; 'but I must run down&#8212;they're
      waiting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no,' said Mrs. le Maistre, seizing Anne's arm, and holding her fast;
      'stay&#8212;you may safely&#8212;for they're all kissing and taking leave,
      and all that, you know; and my lady is talking on about Mr. Soho, and
      giving a hundred directions about legs of TABLES, and so forth, I warrant&#8212;she's
      always an hour after she's ready before she gets in&#8212;and I'm looking
      for the NUMBRELLA. So stay, and tell me&#8212;Mrs. Petito wrote over word
      it was to be Lady Isabel; and then a contradiction came&#8212;it was
      turned into the youngest of the Killpatricks; and now here he's in Miss
      Nugent's dressing-room to the last moment. Now, in my opinion, that am not
      censorious, this does not look so pretty; but, according to my verdict, he
      is only making a fool of Miss Nugent, like the rest; and his lordship
      seems too like what you might call a male COCKET, or a masculine jilt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No more like a masculine jilt than yourself, Mrs. le Maistre,' cried
      Anne, taking fire. 'And my young lady is not a lady to be made a fool of,
      I promise you; nor is my lord likely to make a fool of any woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bless us all! that's no great praise for any young nobleman. Miss Anne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. le Maistre! Mrs. le Maistre! are you above?' cried a footman from
      the bottom of the stairs; 'my lady's calling for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well! very well!' said sharp Mrs. le Maistre; 'very well! and if she
      is&#8212;manners, sir!&#8212;Come up for one, can't you, and don't stand
      bawling at the bottom of the stairs, as if one had no ears to be saved.
      I'm coming as fast as I conveniently can.' Mrs. le Maistre stood in the
      doorway, so as to fill it up, and prevent Anne from passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Anne! Miss Anne! Mrs. le Maistre!' cried another footman; 'my lady's
      in the carriage, and Miss Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Nugent!&#8212;is she?' cried Mrs. le Maistre, running downstairs,
      followed by Anne. 'Now, for the world in pocket-pieces wouldn't I have
      missed seeing him hand Miss Nugent in; for by that I could have judged
      definitively.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, I beg pardon!&#8212;I'm AFEARD I'm late,' said Mrs. le Maistre,
      as she passed Lord Colambre, who was standing motionless in the hall. 'I
      beg a thousand pardons; but I was hunting high and low, for my lady's
      NUMBRELLA.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre did not hear or heed her; his eyes were fixed, and they
      never moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clonbrony was at the open carriage-door, kneeling on the step, and
      receiving Lady Clonbrony's 'more last words' for Mr. Soho. The two
      waiting-maids stood together on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at our young lord, how he stands,' whispered Mrs. le Maistre to
      Anne, 'the image of despair! And she, the picture of death!&#8212;I don't
      know what to think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I; but don't stare if you can help it,' said Anne. 'Get in, get in,
      Mrs. le Maistre,' added she, as Lord Clonbrony now rose from the step, and
      made way for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, in with you&#8212;in with you, Mrs. le Maistre,' said Lord Clonbrony.
      'Good-bye to you, Anne, and take care of your young mistress at Buxton;
      let me see her blooming when we meet again; I don't half like her looks,
      and I never thought Buxton agreed with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Buxton never did anybody harm,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'and as to bloom,
      I'm sure, if Grace has not bloom enough in her cheeks this moment to
      please you, I don't know what you'd have, my dear lord&#8212;Rouge?&#8212;Shut
      the door, John! Oh, stay!&#8212;Colambre! Where upon earth's Colambre?'
      cried her ladyship, stretching from the farthest side of the coach to the
      window. 'Colambre!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Colambre was forced to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Colambre, my dear! I forgot to say that, if anything detains you longer
      than Wednesday se'nnight, I beg you will not fail to write, or I shall be
      miserable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will write; at all events, my dearest mother, you shall hear from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I shall be quite happy. Go on!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do believe Colambre's ill; I never saw a man look so ill in my life&#8212;did
      you, Grace?&#8212;as he did the minute we drove on. He should take advice.
      I've a mind, cried Lady Clonbrony, laying her hand on the cord to stop the
      coachman&#8212;'I've a mind to turn about, tell him so, and ask what is
      the matter with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better not!' said Miss Nugent; 'he will write to you, and tell you&#8212;if
      anything is the matter with him. Better go on now to Buxton!' continued
      she, scarcely able to speak. Lady Clonbrony let go the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what is the matter with you, my dear Grace? for you are certainly
      going to die too!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will tell you&#8212;as soon as I can; but don't ask me now, my dear
      aunt!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grace, Grace! pull the cord!' cried Lady Clonbrony&#8212;'Mr. Salisbury's
      phaeton!&#8212;Mr. Salisbury, I'm happy to see you! We're on our way to
      Buxton&#8212;as I told you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So am I,' said Mr. Salisbury. 'I hope to be there before your ladyship;
      will you honour me with any commands!&#8212;of course, I will see that
      everything is ready for your reception.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship had not any commands. Mr. Salisbury drove on rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony's ideas had now taken the Salisbury channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You didn't know that Mr. Salisbury was going to Buxton to meet you, did
      you, Grace?' said Lady Clonbrony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, indeed, I did not!' said Miss Nugent; 'and I am very sorry for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Young ladies, as Mrs. Broadhurst says, "never know, or at least never
      tell, what they are sorry or glad for,"' replied Lady Clonbrony. 'At all
      events, Grace, my love, it has brought the fine bloom back to your cheeks;
      and I own I am satisfied.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Gone! for ever gone from me!' said Lord Colambre to himself, as the
      carriage drove away. 'Never shall I see her more&#8212;never WILL I see
      her more, till she is married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre went to his own room, locked the door, and was relieved in
      some degree by the sense of privacy; by the feeling that he could now
      indulge his reflections undisturbed. He had consolation&#8212;he had done
      what was honourable&#8212;he had transgressed no duty, abandoned no
      principle&#8212;he had not injured the happiness of any human being&#8212;he
      had not, to gratify himself, hazarded the peace of the woman he loved&#8212;he
      had not sought to win her heart. Of her innocent, her warm, susceptible
      heart, he might perhaps have robbed her&#8212;he knew it&#8212;but he had
      left it untouched, he hoped entire, in her own power, to bless with it
      hereafter some man worthy of her. In the hope that she might be happy,
      Lord Colambre felt relief; and in the consciousness that he had made his
      parents happy, he rejoiced. But, as soon as his mind turned that way for
      consolation, came the bitter concomitant reflection, that his mother must
      be disappointed in her hopes of his accompanying her home, and of his
      living with her in Ireland; she would be miserable when she should hear
      that he was going abroad into the army&#8212;and yet it must be so&#8212;and
      he must write, and tell her so. 'The sooner this difficulty is off my
      mind, the sooner this painful letter is written, the better,' thought he.
      'It must be done&#8212;I will do it immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched up his pen, and began a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear mother&#8212;Miss Nugent&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a knock at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A gentleman below, my lord,' said a servant, 'who wishes to see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot see any gentleman. Did you say I was at home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my lord; I said you was not at home; for I thought you would not
      choose to be at home, and your own man was not in the way for me to ask&#8212;so
      I denied you; but the gentleman would not be denied; he said I must come
      and see if you was at home. So, as he spoke as if he was a gentleman not
      used to be denied, I thought it might be somebody of consequence, and I
      showed him into the front drawing-room. I think he said he was sure you'd
      be at home for a friend from Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A friend from Ireland! Why did not you tell me that sooner?' said Lord
      Colambre, rising, and running downstairs. 'Sir James Brooke, I daresay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not Sir James Brooke; but one he was almost as glad to see&#8212;Count
      O'Halloran!
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear count! the greater pleasure for being unexpected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I came to London but yesterday,' said the count; 'but I could not be here
      a day, without doing myself the honour of paying my respects to Lord
      Colambre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You do me not only honour, but pleasure, my dear count. People when they
      like one another, always find each other out, and contrive to meet even in
      London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are too polite to ask what brought such a superannuated militaire as
      I am,' said the count, 'from his retirement into this gay world again. A
      relation of mine, who is one of our Ministry, knew that I had some maps,
      and plans, and charts, which might be serviceable in an expedition they
      are planning. I might have trusted my charts across the channel, without
      coming myself to convoy them, you will say. But my relation fancied&#8212;young
      relations, you know, if they are good for anything, are apt to overvalue
      the heads of old relations&#8212;fancied that mine was worth bringing all
      the way from Halloran Castle to London, to consult with TETE-A-TETE. So
      you know, when this was signified to me by a letter from the secretary in
      office, PRIVATE, MOST CONFIDENTIAL, what could I do, but do myself the
      honour to obey? For though honour's voice cannot provoke the silent dust,
      yet "flattery soothes the dull cold ear of AGE."&#8212;But enough, and too
      much of myself,' said the count: 'tell me, my dear lord, something of
      yourself. I do not think England seems to agree with you so well as
      Ireland; for, excuse me, in point of health, you don't look like the same
      man I saw some weeks ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My mind has been ill at ease of late,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, there's the thing! The body pays for the mind&#8212;but those who
      have feeling minds, pain and pleasure altogether computed, have the
      advantage; or at least they think so; for they would not change with those
      who have them not, were they to gain by the bargain the most robust body
      that the most selfish coxcomb, or the heaviest dunce extant, ever boasted.
      For instance, would you now, my lord, at this moment change altogether
      with Major Benson, or Captain Williamson, or even our friend, 'Eh, really
      now, "pon honour"&#8212;would you!&#8212;I'm glad to see you smile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thank you for making me smile, for I assure you I want it. I wish&#8212;if
      you would not think me encroaching upon your politeness and kindness in
      honouring me with this visit&#8212;You see,' continued he, opening the
      doors of the back drawing-room, and pointing to large packages&#8212;'you
      see we are all preparing for a march; my mother has left town half an hour
      ago&#8212;my father engaged to dine abroad&#8212;only I at home&#8212;and,
      in this state of confusion, could I even venture to ask Count O'Halloran
      to stay and dine with me, without being able to offer him Irish ortolans
      or Irish plums&#8212;in short, will you let me rob you of two or three
      hours of your time? I am anxious to have your opinion on a subject of some
      importance to me, and on one where you are peculiarly qualified to judge
      and decide for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear lord, frankly, I have nothing half so good or so agreeable to do
      with my time; command my hours. I have already told you how much it
      flatters me to be consulted by the most helpless clerk in office; how much
      more about the private concerns of an enlightened young&#8212;friend, will
      Lord Colambre permit me to say? I hope so; for though the length of our
      acquaintance might not justify the word, yet regard and intimacy are not
      always in proportion to the time people have known each other, but to
      their mutual perception of certain attaching qualities, a certain
      similarity and suitableness of character.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The good count, seeing that Lord Colambre was in much distress of mind,
      did all he could to soothe him by kindness; far from making any difficulty
      about giving up a few hours of his time, he seemed to have no other object
      in London, and no purpose in life, but to attend to our hero. To put him
      at ease, and to give him time to recover and arrange his thoughts, the
      count talked of indifferent subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I heard you mention the name of Sir James Brooke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I expected to have seen him when the servant first mentioned a
      friend from Ireland; because Sir James had told me that, as soon as he
      could get leave of absence, he would come to England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is come; is now at his estate is Huntingdonshire; doing, what do you
      think? I will give you a leading hint; recollect the seal which the little
      De Cresey put into your hands the day you dined at Oranmore. Faithful to
      his motto, "Deeds not words," he is this instant, I believe, at deeds,
      title-deeds; making out marriage settlements, getting ready to put his
      seal to the happy articles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Happy man! I give him joy,' said Lord Colambre; 'happy man! going to be
      married to such a woman&#8212;daughter of such a mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Daughter of such a mother! That is indeed a great addition and a great
      security to his happiness,' said the count. 'Such a family to marry into;
      good from generation to generation; illustrious by character as well as by
      genealogy; "all the sons brave, and all the daughters chaste."'&#8212;Lord
      Colambre with difficulty repressed his feelings.&#8212;'if I could choose,
      I would rather that a woman I loved were of such a family than that she
      had for her dower the mines of Peru.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So would I,' cried Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am glad to hear you say so, my lord, and with such energy; so few young
      men of the present day look to what I call good connexion. In marrying, a
      man does not, to be sure, marry his wife's mother; and yet a prudent man,
      when he begins to think of the daughter, would look sharp at the mother;
      ay, and back to the grandmother too, and along the whole female line of
      ancestry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True&#8212;most true&#8212;he ought he must.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I have a notion,' said the count, smiling, 'your lordship's practice
      has been conformable to your theory.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I!&#8212;mine!' said Lord Colambre, starling, and looking at the count
      with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon,' said the count; 'I did not intend to surprise your
      confidence. But you forget that I was present, and saw the impression
      which was made on your mind by a mother's want of a proper sense of
      delicacy and propriety&#8212;Lady Dashfort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Lady Dashfort! she was quite out of my head.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Lady Isabel?&#8212;I hope she is quite out of your heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She never was in it,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only laid siege to it,' said the count. 'Well, I am glad your heart did
      not surrender at discretion, or rather without discretion. Then I may tell
      you, without fear or preface, that the Lady Isabel, who "talks of
      refinement, delicacy, sense," is going to stoop at once, and marry&#8212;Heathcock.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was not surprised, but concerned and disgusted, as he always
      felt, even when he did not care for the individual, from hearing anything
      which tended to lower the female sex in public estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As to myself,' said he, 'I cannot say I have had an escape, for I don't
      think I ever was in much danger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is difficult to measure danger when it is over&#8212;past danger, like
      past pain, is soon forgotten,' said the old general. 'At all events, I
      rejoice in your present safety.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But is she really going to be married to Heathcock?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Positively; they all came over in the same packet with me, and they are
      all in town now, buying jewels, and equipages, and horses. Heathcock, you
      know, is as good as another man, A PEU PRES, for all those purposes; his
      father is dead, and left him a large estate. QUE VOULEZ VOUS? as the
      French valet said to me on the occasion. C'EST QUE MONSIEUR EST UN HOMME
      DE BIEN: IL A DES BIENS, A CE QU'ON DIT.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre could not help smiling. 'How they got Heathcock to fall in
      love is what puzzles me,' said his lordship. 'I should as soon have
      thought of an oyster's falling in love as that being!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I own I should have sooner thought,' replied the count, 'Of his falling
      in love with an oyster; and so would you, if you had seen him, as I did,
      devouring oysters on shipboard.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">      'Say, can the lovely HEROINE hope to vie<br />       With a fat turtle or a ven'son pie?<br />    </pre>
    <p>
      But that is not our affair; let the Lady Isabel look to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was announced; and no farther conversation of any consequence
      passed between the count and Lord Colambre till the cloth was removed and
      the servants had withdrawn. Then our hero opened on the subject which was
      heavy at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear count&#8212;to go back to the BURIAL PLACE OF THE NUGENTS, where
      my head was lost the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you&#8212;you
      know, or, possibly,' said he, smiling, 'you do not know, that I have a
      cousin of the name of Nugent?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You told me,' replied the count, 'that you had near relations of that
      name; but I do not recollect that you mentioned any one in particular.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never named Miss Nugent to you. No! it is not easy to me to talk of
      her, and impossible to me to describe her. If you had come one half-hour
      sooner this morning, you would have seen her: I know she is exactly suited
      to your excellent taste. But it is not at first sight she pleases most;
      she gains upon the affections, attaches the heart, and unfolds upon the
      judgment. In temper, manners, and good sense, in every quality a man can
      or should desire in a wife, I never saw her equal. Yet, there is an
      obstacle, an invincible obstacle, the nature of which I cannot explain to
      you, that forbids me to think of her as a wife. She lives with my father
      and mother: they are returning to Ireland, I wished, earnestly wished, on
      many accounts, to have accompanied them, chiefly on my mother's; but it
      cannot be. The first thing a man must do is to act honourably; and, that
      he may do so, he must keep out of the way of a temptation which he
      believes to be above his strength. I will never see Miss Nugent again till
      she is married; I must either stay in England, or go abroad. I have a mind
      to serve a campaign or two, if I could get a commission in a regiment
      going to Spain; but I understand so many are eager to go at this moment,
      that it is very difficult to get a commission in such a regiment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is difficult,' said the count. 'But,' added he, after thinking for a
      moment, 'I have it! I can get the thing done for you, and directly. Major
      Benson, in consequence of that affair, you know, about his mistress, is
      forced to quit the regiment. When the lieutenant-colonel came to quarters,
      and the rest of the officers heard the fact, they would not keep company
      with Benson, and would not mess with him. I know he wants to sell out; and
      that regiment is to be ordered immediately to Spain. I will have the thing
      done for you, if you request it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'First, give me your advice, Count O'Halloran; you are well acquainted
      with the military profession, with military life. Would you advise me&#8212;I
      won't speak of myself, because we judge better by general views than by
      particular cases&#8212;would you advise a young man at present to go into
      the army?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The count was silent for a few minutes, and then replied: 'Since you
      seriously ask my opinion, my lord, I must lay aside my own prepossessions,
      and endeavour to speak with impartiality. To go into the army in these
      days, my lord, is, in my sober opinion, the most absurd and base, or the
      wisest and noblest thing a young man can do. To enter into the army, with
      the hope of escaping from the application necessary to acquire knowledge,
      letters, and science&#8212;I run no risk, my lord, in saying this to you&#8212;to
      go into the army, with the hope of escaping from knowledge, letters,
      science, and morality; to wear a red coat and an epaulette; to be called
      captain; to figure at a ball; to lounge away time in country sports, at
      country quarters, was never, even in times of peace, creditable; but it is
      now absurd and base. Submitting to a certain portion of ennui and
      contempt, this mode of life for an officer was formerly practicable&#8212;but
      now cannot be submitted to without utter, irremediable disgrace. Officers
      are now, in general, men of education and information; want of knowledge,
      sense, manners, must consequently be immediately detected, ridiculed, and
      despised in a military man. Of this we have not long since seen lamentable
      examples in the raw officers who have lately disgraced themselves in my
      neighbourhood in Ireland&#8212;that Major Benson and Captain Williamson.
      But I will not advert to such insignificant individuals, such are rare
      exceptions&#8212;I leave them out of the question&#8212;I reason on
      general principles. The life of an officer is not now a life of parade, of
      coxcombical, or of profligate idleness&#8212;but of active service, of
      continual hardship and danger. All the descriptions which we see in
      ancient history of a soldier's life&#8212;descriptions which, in times of
      peace, appeared like romance&#8212;are now realised; military exploits
      fill every day's newspapers, every day's conversation. A martial spirit is
      now essential to the liberty and the existence of our own country. In the
      present state of things, the military must be the most honourable
      profession, because the most useful. Every movement of an army is
      followed, wherever it goes, by the public hopes and fears. Every officer
      must now feel, besides this sense of collective importance, a belief that
      his only dependence must be on his own merit and thus his ambition, his
      enthusiasm, are raised; and when once this noble ardour is kindled in the
      breast, it excites to exertion, and supports under endurance. But I forget
      myself,' said the count, checking his enthusiasm; 'I promised to speak
      soberly. If I have said too much, your own good sense, my lord, will
      correct me, and your good-nature will forgive the prolixity of an old man,
      touched upon his favourite subject&#8212;the passion of his youth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, of course, assured the count that he was not tired. Indeed,
      the enthusiasm with which this old officer spoke of his profession, and
      the high point of view in which he placed it, increased our hero's desire
      to serve a campaign abroad. Good sense, politeness, and experience of the
      world preserved Count O'Halloran from that foible with which old officers
      are commonly reproached, of talking continually of their own military
      exploits. Though retired from the world, he had contrived, by reading the
      best books, and corresponding with persons of good information, to keep up
      with the current of modern affairs; and he seldom spoke of those in which
      he had been formerly engaged. He rather too studiously avoided speaking of
      himself; and this fear of egotism diminished the peculiar interest he
      might have inspired: it disappointed curiosity, and deprived those with
      whom he conversed of many entertaining and instructive anecdotes. However,
      he sometimes made exceptions to his general rule in favour of persons who
      peculiarly pleased him, and Lord Colambre was of this number.
    </p>
    <p>
      He this evening, for the first time, spoke to his lordship of the years he
      had spent in the Austrian service; told him anecdotes of the emperor;
      spoke of many distinguished public characters whom he had known abroad; of
      those officers who had been his friends and companions. Among others he
      mentioned, with particular regard, a young English officer who had been at
      the same time with him in the Austrian service, a gentleman of the name of
      Reynolds. The name struck Lord Colambre; it was the name of the officer
      who had been the cause of the disgrace of Miss St. Omar&#8212;of Miss
      Nugent's mother. 'But there are so many Reynoldses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He eagerly asked the age&#8212;the character of this officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was a gallant youth,' said the count, 'but too adventurous&#8212;too
      rash. He fell, after distinguishing himself in a glorious manner, in his
      twentieth year&#8212;died in my arms.' 'Married or unmarried?' cried Lord
      Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Married&#8212;he had been privately married, less than a year before his
      death, to a very young English lady, who had been educated at a convent in
      Vienna. He was heir to a considerable property, I believe, and the young
      lady had little fortune; and the affair was kept secret from the fear of
      offending his friends, or for some other reason&#8212;I do not recollect
      the particulars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he acknowledge his marriage?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never till he was dying&#8212;then he confided his secret to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you recollect the name of the young lady he married?' 'Yes&#8212;Miss
      St. Omar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'St. Omar!' repeated Lord Colambre, with an expression of lively joy in
      his countenance. 'But are you certain, my dear count, that she was really
      married, legally married, to Mr. Reynolds? Her marriage has been denied by
      all his friends and relations&#8212;hers have never been able to establish
      it&#8212;her daughter is&#8212;My dear count, were you present at the
      marriage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said the count, 'I was not present at the marriage; I never saw the
      lady, nor do I know anything of the affair, except that Mr. Reynolds, when
      he was dying, assured me that he was privately married to a Miss St. Omar,
      who was then boarding at a convent in Vienna. The young man expressed
      great regret at leaving her totally unprovided for; but said that he
      trusted his father would acknowledge her, and that her friends would be
      reconciled to her. He was not of age, he said, to make a will; but I think
      he told me that his child, who at that time was not born, would, even if
      it should be a girl, inherit a considerable property. With this, I cannot,
      however, charge my memory positively; but he put a packet into my hands
      which, he told me, contained a certificate of his marriage, and, I think
      he said, a letter to his father; this he requested that I would transmit
      to England by some safe hand. Immediately after his death, I went to the
      English ambassador, who was then leaving Vienna, and delivered the packet
      into his hands; he promised to have it safely delivered. I was obliged to
      go the next day, with the troops, to a distant part of the country. When I
      returned, I inquired at the convent what had become of Miss St. Omar&#8212;I
      should say Mrs. Reynolds; and I was told that she had removed from the
      convent to private lodgings in the town, some time previous to the birth
      of her child. The abbess seemed much scandalised by the whole transaction;
      and I remember I relieved her mind by assuring her that there had been a
      regular marriage. For poor young Reynolds's sake, I made farther inquiries
      about the widow, intending, of course, to act as a friend, if she was in
      any difficulty or distress. But I found, on inquiry at her lodgings, that
      her brother had come from England for her, and had carried her and her
      infant away. The active scenes,' continued the count, 'in which I was
      immediately afterwards engaged, drove the whole affair from my mind. Now
      that your questions have recalled them, I feel certain of the facts I have
      mentioned; and I am ready to establish them by my testimony.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre thanked him with an eagerness that showed how much he was
      interested in the event. It was clear, he said, either that the packet
      left with the ambassador had not been delivered, or that the father of Mr.
      Reynolds had suppressed the certificate of the marriage, as it had never
      been acknowledged by him or by any of the family. Lord Colambre now
      frankly told the count why he was so anxious about this affair; and Count
      O'Halloran, with all the warmth of youth, and with all the ardent
      generosity characteristic of his country, entered into his feelings,
      declaring that he would never rest till he had established the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unfortunately,' said the count, 'the ambassador who took the packet in
      charge is dead. I am afraid we shall have difficulty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he must have had some secretary,' said Lord Colambre; 'who was his
      secretary?&#8212;we can apply to him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His secretary is now CHARGE D'AFFAIRES in Vienna&#8212;we cannot get at
      him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Into whose hands have that ambassador's papers fallen&#8212;who is his
      executor?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His executor!&#8212;now you have it,' cried the count. 'His executor is
      the very man who will do your business&#8212;your friend Sir James Brooke
      is the executor. All papers, of course, are in his hands; or he can have
      access to any that are in the hands of the family. The family seat is
      within a few miles of Sir James Brooke's, in Huntingdonshire, where, as I
      told you before, he now is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go to him immediately&#8212;set out in the mail this night. Just in
      time!' cried Lord Colambre, pulling out his watch with one hand, and
      ringing the bell with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Run and take a place for me in the mail for Huntingdon. Go directly,'
      said Lord Colambre to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And take two places, if you please, sir,' said the count. 'My lord, I
      will accompany you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Lord Colambre would not permit, as it would be unnecessary to
      fatigue the good old general; and a letter from him to Sir James Brooke
      would do all that the count could effect by his presence; the search for
      the papers would be made by Sir James, and if the packet could be
      recovered, or if any memorandum or mode of ascertaining that it had
      actually been delivered to old Reynolds could be discovered, Lord Colambre
      said he would then call upon the count for his assistance, and trouble him
      to identify the packet; or to go with him to Mr. Reynolds to make farther
      inquiries; and to certify, at all events, the young man's dying
      acknowledgment of his marriage and of his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place in the mail, just in time, was taken. Lord Colambre sent a
      servant in search of his father, with a note explaining the necessity of
      his sudden departure. All the business which remained to be done in town
      he knew Lord Clonbrony could accomplish without his assistance. Then he
      wrote a few lines to his mother, on the very sheet of paper on which, a
      few hours before, he had sorrowfully and slowly begun&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MOTHER MISS NUGENT. He now joyfully and rapidly went on&#8212;MY
      DEAR MOTHER AND MISS NUGENT, I hope to be with you on Wednesday se'nnight;
      but if unforeseen circumstances should delay me, I will certainly write to
      you again.&#8212;Dear mother, believe me, your obliged and grateful son,
      COLAMBRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count, in the meantime, wrote a letter for him to Sir James Brooke,
      describing the packet which he had given to the ambassador, and relating
      all the circumstances that could lead to its recovery. Lord Colambre,
      almost before the wax was hard, seized possession of the letter; the count
      seeming almost as eager to hurry him off as he was to set out. He thanked
      the count with few words, but with strong feeling. Joy and love returned
      in full tide upon our hero's soul; all the military ideas, which but an
      hour before filled his imagination, were put to flight: Spain vanished,
      and green Ireland reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they shook hands at parting, the good old general, with a smile,
      said to him, 'I believe I had better not stir in the matter of Benson's
      commission till I hear more from you. My harangue, in favour of the
      military profession, will, I fancy, prove like most other harangues, EN
      PURE PERTE.'

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In what words of polite circumlocution, or of cautious diplomacy, shall we
      say, or hint, that the deceased ambassador's papers were found in shameful
      disorder. His excellency's executor, Sir James Brooke, however, was
      indefatigable in his researches. He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days
      in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and
      bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any
      docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others
      written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their
      nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately. At last,
      when they had opened, as they thought, every paper, and, wearied and in
      despair, were just on the point of giving up the search, Lord Colambre
      spied a bundle of old newspapers at the bottom of a trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are only old Vienna Gazettes; I looked at them,' said Sir James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre, upon this assurance, was going to throw them into the trunk
      again; but observing that the bundle had not been untied, he opened it,
      and within-side of the newspapers he found a rough copy of the
      ambassador's journal, and with it the packet, directed to Ralph Reynolds
      sen., Esq., Old Court, Suffolk, per favour of his excellency, Earl &#8212;,
      a note on the cover, signed O'Halloran, stating when received by him, and
      the date of the day when delivered to the ambassador&#8212;seals unbroken.
      Our hero was in such a transport of joy at the sight of this packet, and
      his friend Sir James Brooke so full of his congratulations, that they
      forgot to curse the ambassador's carelessness, which had been the cause of
      so much evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing to be done was to deliver the packet to Ralph Reynolds, Old
      Court, Suffolk. But when Lord Colambre arrived at Old Court, Suffolk, he
      found all the gates locked, and no admittance to be had. At last an old
      woman came out of the porter's lodge, who said Mr. Reynolds was not there,
      and she could not say where he was. After our hero had opened her heart by
      the present of half a guinea, she explained, that she 'could not JUSTLY
      say where he was, because that he never let anybody of his own people know
      where he was any day; he had several different houses and places in
      different parts, and far-off counties, and other shires, as she heard, and
      by times he was at one, and by times at another.' The names of two of the
      places, Toddrington and Little Wrestham, she knew; but there were others
      to which she could give no direction. He had houses in odd parts of
      London, too, that he let; and sometimes, when the lodgers' time was out,
      he would go, and be never heard of for a month, maybe, in one of them. In
      short, there was no telling or saying where he was or would be one day of
      the week, by where he had been the last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lord Colambre expressed some surprise that an old gentleman, as he
      conceived Mr. Ralph Reynolds to be, should change places so frequently,
      the old woman answered, 'That though her master was a deal on the wrong
      side of seventy, and though, to look at him, you'd think he was glued to
      his chair, and would fall to pieces if he should stir out of it, yet was
      as alert, and thought no more of going about, than if he was as young as
      the gentleman who was now speaking to her. It was old Mr. Reynolds's
      delight to come down and surprise his people at his different places, and
      see that they were keeping all tight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What sort of a man is he;&#8212;Is he a miser?' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is a miser, and he is not a miser,' said the woman. 'Now he'd think as
      much of the waste of a penny as another man would of a hundred pounds, and
      yet he would give a hundred pounds easier than another would give a penny,
      when he's in the humour. But his humour is very odd, and there's no
      knowing where to have him; he's gross-grained, and more POSITIVER-like
      than a mule; and his deafness made him worse in this, because he never
      heard what nobody said, but would say on his own way&#8212;he was very ODD
      but not CRACKED&#8212;no, he was as clear-headed, when he took a thing the
      right way, as any man could be, and as clever, and could talk as well as
      any member of Parliament,&#8212;and good-natured, and kind-hearted, where
      he would take a fancy&#8212;but then, maybe, it would be to a dog (he was
      remarkable fond of dogs), or a cat, or a rat even, that he would take a
      fancy, and think more of 'em than he would of a Christian. But, Poor
      gentleman, there's great allowance,' said she, 'to be made for him, that
      lost his son and heir&#8212;that would have been heir to all, and a fine
      youth that he doted upon. But,' continued the old woman, in whose mind the
      transitions from GREAT to little, from serious to trivial, were
      ludicrously abrupt, 'that was no reason why the old gentleman should scold
      me last time he was here, as he did, for as long as ever he could stand
      over me, only because I killed a mouse who was eating my cheese; and,
      before night, he beat a boy for stealing a piece of that same cheese; and
      he would never, when down here, let me set a mouse-trap.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my good woman,' interrupted Lord Colambre, who was little
      interested in this affair of the mouse-trap, and nowise curious to learn
      more of Mr. Reynolds's domestic economy, 'I'll not trouble you any
      farther, if you can be so good as to tell me the road to Toddrington, or
      to Little Wickham, I think you call it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Wickham!' repeated the woman, laughing&#8212;' Bless you, sir,
      where do you come from?&#8212;It's Little Wrestham; surely everybody
      knows, near Lantry; and keep the PIKE till you come to the turn at
      Rotherford, and then you strike off into the by-road to the left, and then
      again turn at the ford to the right. But, if you are going to Toddrington,
      you don't go the road to market, which is at the first turn to the left,
      and the cross-country road, where there's no quarter, and Toddrington lies&#8212;but
      for Wrestham, you take the road to market.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before our hero could persuade the old woman to stick to
      Little Wrestham, or to Toddrington, and not to mix the directions for the
      different roads together&#8212;he took patience, for his impatience only
      confused his director the more. In process of time, he made out, and wrote
      down, the various turns that he was to follow, to reach Little Wrestham;
      but no human power could get her from Little Wrestham to Toddrington,
      though she knew the road perfectly well; but she had, for the seventeen
      last years, been used to go 'the other road,' and all the carriers went
      that way, and passed the door, and that was all she could certify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Wrestham, after turning to the left and right as often as his
      directory required, our hero happily reached; but, unhappily, he found no
      Mr. Reynolds there; only a steward, who gave nearly the same account of
      his master as had been given by the old woman, and could not guess even
      where the gentleman might now be. Toddrington was as likely as any place&#8212;but
      he could not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perseverance against fortune.' To Toddrington our hero proceeded, through
      cross-country roads&#8212;such roads!&#8212;very different from the Irish
      roads. Waggon ruts, into which the carriage wheels sunk nearly to the nave&#8212;and,
      from time to time, 'sloughs of despond,' through which it seemed
      impossible to drag, walk, wade, or swim, and all the time with a sulky
      postillion. 'Oh, how unlike my Larry!' thought Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in a very narrow lane, going up a hill, said to be two miles of
      ascent, they overtook a heavy laden waggon, and they were obliged to go
      step by step behind it, whilst, enjoying the gentleman's impatience much,
      and the postillion's sulkiness more, the waggoner, in his embroidered
      frock, walked in state, with his long sceptre in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postillion muttered 'curses not loud, but deep.' Deep or loud, no
      purpose would they have answered; the waggoner's temper was proof against
      curse in or out of the English language; and from their snail's pace
      neither DICKENS nor devil, nor any postillion in England, could make him
      put his horses. Lord Colambre jumped out of the chaise, and, walking
      beside him, began to talk to him; and spoke of his horses, their bells,
      their trappings; the beauty and strength of the thill-horse&#8212;the
      value of the whole team, which his lordship happening to guess right
      within ten pounds, and showing, moreover, some skill about road-making and
      waggon-wheels, and being fortunately of the waggoner's own opinion in the
      great question about conical and cylindrical rims, he was pleased with the
      young chap of a gentleman; and, in spite of the chuffiness of his
      appearance and churlishness of his speech, this waggoner's bosom 'being
      made of penetrating stuff,' he determined to let the gentleman pass.
      Accordingly, when half-way up the hill, and the head of the fore-horse
      came near an open gate, the waggoner, without saying one word or turning
      his head, touched the horse with his long whip&#8212;and the horse turned
      in at the gate, and then came&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dobbin!&#8212;Jeho!' and strange calls and sounds, which all the other
      horses of the team obeyed; and the waggon turned into the farmyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, master! while I turn, you may pass.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The covering of the waggon caught in the hedge as the waggon turned in;
      and as the sacking was drawn back, some of the packages were disturbed&#8212;a
      cheese was just rolling off on the side next Lord Colambre; he stopped it
      from falling; the direction caught his quick eye&#8212;'To Ralph Reynolds,
      Esq.'&#8212;'TODDRINGTON' scratched out; 'Red Lion Square, London,'
      written in another hand below.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I have found him! And surely I know that hand!' said Lord Colambre to
      himself, looking more closely at the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original direction was certainly in a handwriting well known to him it
      was Lady Dashfort's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That there cheese, that you're looking at so cur'ously,' said the
      waggoner, has been a great traveller; for it came all the way down from
      Lon'on, and now it's going all the way up again back, on account of not
      finding the gentleman at home; and the man that booked it told me as how
      it came from foreign parts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre took down the direction, tossed the honest waggoner a
      guinea, wished him good-night, passed, and went on. As soon as he could,
      he turned into the London road&#8212;at the first town, got a place in the
      mail&#8212;reached London&#8212;saw his father&#8212;went directly to his
      friend, Count O'Halloran, who was delighted when he beheld the packet.
      Lord Colambre was extremely eager to go immediately to old Reynolds,
      fatigued as he was; for he had travelled night and day, and had scarcely
      allowed himself, mind or body, one moment's repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heroes must sleep, and lovers too; or they soon will cease to be heroes
      or lovers!' said the count. 'Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! this night; and
      to-morrow morning we'll finish the adventure in Red Lion Square, or I will
      accompany you when and where you will; if necessary, to earth's remotest
      bounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Lord Colambre went to breakfast with the count. The
      count, who was not in love, was not up, for our hero was half an hour
      earlier than the time appointed. The old servant Ulick, who had attended
      his master to England, was very glad to see Lord Colambre again, and,
      showing him into the breakfast parlour, could not help saying, in defence
      of his master's punctuality&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your clocks, I suppose, my lord, are half an hour faster than ours; my
      master will be ready to the moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The count soon appeared&#8212;breakfast was soon over, and the carriage at
      the door; for the count sympathised in his young friend's impatience. As
      they were setting out, the count's large Irish dog pushed out of the house
      door to follow them and his master would have forbidden him, but Lord
      Colambre begged that he might be permitted to accompany them; for his
      lordship recollected the old woman's having mentioned that Mr. Reynolds
      was fond of dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived in Red Lion Square, found the house of Mr. Reynolds, and,
      contrary to the count's prognostics, found the old gentleman up, and they
      saw him in his red night-cap at his parlour window. After some minutes'
      running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage, and two or three
      peeps taken over the blinds by the old gentleman, they were admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy could not master their names; so they were obliged reciprocally to
      announce themselves&#8212;'Count O'Halloran and Lord Colambre.' The names
      seemed to make no impression on the old gentleman; but he deliberately
      looked at the count and his lordship, as if studying WHAT rather than WHO
      they were. In spite of the red night-cap, and a flowered dressing-gown,
      Mr. Reynolds looked like a gentleman, an odd gentleman&#8212;but still a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Count O'Halloran came into the room, and as his large dog attempted to
      follow, the count's voice expressed: 'Say, shall I let him in, or shut the
      door?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, let him in, by all means, sir, if you please! I am fond of dogs; and
      a finer one I never saw; pray, gentlemen, be seated,' said he&#8212;a
      portion of the complacency inspired by the sight of the dog, diffusing
      itself over his manner towards the master of so fine an animal, and even
      extending to the master's companion, though in an inferior degree. Whilst
      Mr. Reynolds stroked the dog, the count told him that 'the dog was of a
      curious breed, now almost extinct&#8212;the Irish greyhound, of which only
      one nobleman in Ireland, it is said, has now a few of the species
      remaining in his possession&#8212;Now, lie down, Hannibal,' said the
      count. 'Mr. Reynolds, we have taken the liberty, though strangers, of
      waiting upon you&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I beg your pardon, sir,' interrupted Mr. Reynolds; 'but did I understand
      you rightly, that a few of the same species are still to be had from one
      nobleman in Ireland? pray, what is his name?' said he, taking out his
      pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count wrote the name for him, but observed, that 'he had asserted only
      that a few of these dogs remained in the possession of that nobleman; he
      could not answer for it that they were TO BE HAD.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I have ways and means,' said old Reynolds; and, rapping his
      snuff-box, and talking, as it was his custom, loud to himself, 'Lady
      Dashfort knows all those Irish lords; she shall get one for me&#8212;ay!
      ay!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran replied, as if the words had been addressed to him&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady Dashfort is in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it, sir; she is in London,' said Mr. Reynolds, hastily. 'What do
      you know of her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know, sir, that she is not likely to return to Ireland, and that I am;
      and so is my young friend here; and if the thing can be accomplished, we
      will get it done for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre joined in this promise, and added that, 'if the dog could be
      obtained, he would undertake to have him safely sent over to England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir&#8212;gentlemen! I'm much obliged; that is, when you have done the
      thing I shall be much obliged. But, maybe, you are only making me civil
      speeches!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of that, sir,' said the count, smiling with much temper, 'your own
      sagacity and knowledge of the world must enable you to judge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For my own part, I can only say,' cried Lord Colambre, 'that I am not in
      the habit of being reproached with saying one thing and meaning another.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hot! I see,' said old Reynolds, nodding, as he looked at Lord Colambre.
      'Cool!' added he, nodding at the count. 'But a time for everything; I was
      hot once&#8212;both answers good, for their ages.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech Lord Colombre and the count tacitly agreed to consider as
      another APART, which they were not to hear, or seem to hear. The count
      began again on the business of their visit, as he saw that Lord Colambre
      was boiling with impatience, and feared that he should BOIL OVER, and
      spoil all. The count commenced with&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Reynolds, your name sounds to me like the name of a friend; for I had
      once a friend of that name; I had once the pleasure (and a very great
      pleasure it was to me) to be intimately acquainted abroad, on the
      Continent, with a very amiable and gallant youth&#8212;your son!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take care, sir,' said the old man, starting up from his chair, and
      instantly sinking down again&#8212;'take care! Don't mention him to me&#8212;unless
      you would strike me dead on the spot!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The convulsed motions of his fingers and face worked for some moments;
      whilst the count and Lord Colambre, much shocked and alarmed, stood in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convulsed motions ceased; and the old man unbuttoned his waistcoat, as
      if to relieve some sense of expression; uncovered his gray hairs; and,
      after leaning back to rest himself, with his eyes fixed, and in reverie
      for a few moments, he sat upright again in his chair, and exclaimed, as he
      looked round&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Son!&#8212;Did not somebody say that word? Who is so cruel to say that
      word before me? Nobody has ever spoken of him to me&#8212;but once, since
      his death! Do you know, sir,' said he, fixing his eyes on Count
      O'Halloran, and laying his cold hand on him, 'do you know where he was
      buried, I ask you, sir? do you remember how he died?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too well! too well!' cried the count, so much affected as to be scarcely
      able to pronounce the words; 'he died in my arms; I buried him myself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Impossible!' cried Mr. Reynolds. 'Why do you say so, sir?' said he,
      studying the count's face with a sort of bewildered earnestness.
      'Impossible! His body was sent over to me in a lead coffin; and I saw it
      and I was asked&#8212;and I answered, "in the family vault." But the shock
      is over,' said he; 'and, gentlemen, if the business of your visit relates
      to that subject, I trust I am now sufficiently composed to attend to you.
      Indeed, I ought to be prepared; for I had reason, for years, to expect the
      stroke; and yet, when it came, it seemed sudden!&#8212;it stunned me&#8212;put
      an end to all my worldly prospects&#8212;left me childless, without a
      single descendant or relation near enough to be dear to me! I am an
      insulated being!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir, you are not an insulated being,' said Lord Colambre 'you have a
      near relation, who will, who must be dear to you; who will make you amends
      for all you have lost, all you have suffered&#8212;who will bring peace
      and joy to your heart. You have a grand-daughter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir; I have no grand-daughter,' said old Reynolds, his face and whole
      form becoming rigid with the expression of obstinacy. 'Rather have no
      descendant than be forced to acknowledge an illegitimate child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My lord, I entreat as a friend&#8212;I command you to be patient,' said
      the count, who saw Lord Colambre's indignation suddenly rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So, then, this is the purpose of your visit,' continued old Reynolds;
      'and you come from my enemies, from the St. Omars, and you are in a league
      with them,' continued old Reynolds; 'and all this time it is of my eldest
      son you have been talking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir,' replied the count; 'of Captain Reynolds, who fell in battle,
      in the Austrian service, about nineteen years ago&#8212;a more gallant and
      amiable youth never lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasure revived through the dull look of obstinacy in the father's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was, as you say, sir, a gallant, an amiable youth, once and he was my
      pride, and I loved him, too, once but did not you know I had another?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir, we did not&#8212;we are, you may perceive, totally ignorant of
      your family and of your affairs we have no connexion whatever or knowledge
      of any of the St. Omars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I detest the sound of the name,' cried Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, good! good!&#8212;Well! well! I beg your pardon, gentlemen, a
      thousand times&#8212;I am a hasty, very hasty old man; but I have been
      harassed, persecuted, hunted by wretches, who got a scent of my gold;
      often in my rage I longed to throw my treasure-bags to my pursuers, and
      bid them leave me to die in peace. You have feelings, I see, both of you,
      gentlemen; excuse me, and bear with my temper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bear with you! Much enforced, the best tempers will emit a hasty spark,'
      said the count, looking at Lord Colambre, who was now cool again; and who,
      with a countenance full of compassion, sat with his eyes fixed upon the
      poor&#8212;no, not the poor, but the unhappy old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I had another son,' continued Mr. Reynolds, 'and on him all my
      affections concentrated when I lost my eldest, and for him I desired to
      preserve the estate which his mother brought into my family. Since you
      know nothing of my affairs, let me explain to you; that estate was so
      settled, that it would have gone to the child, even the daughter of my
      eldest son, if there had been a legitimate child. But I knew there was no
      marriage, and I held out firm to my opinion. "If there was a marriage,"
      said I, "show me the marriage certificate, and I will acknowledge the
      marriage, and acknowledge the child;" but they could not, and I knew they
      could not; and I kept the estate for my darling boy,' cried the old
      gentleman, with the exultation of successful positiveness again appearing
      strong in his physiognomy; but suddenly changing and relaxing, his
      countenance fell, and he added, 'But now I have no darling boy. What use
      all!&#8212;all must go to the heir-at-law, or I must will it to a stranger&#8212;a
      lady of quality, who has just found out she is my relation&#8212;God knows
      how&#8212;I'm no genealogist&#8212;and sends me Irish cheese and Iceland
      moss, for my breakfast, and her waiting-gentlewoman to namby-pamby me. Oh,
      I'm sick of it all&#8212;see through it&#8212;wish I was blind&#8212;wish
      I had a hiding-place, where flatterers could not find me&#8212;pursued,
      chased&#8212;must change my lodgings again to-morrow&#8212;will, will&#8212;I
      beg your pardon, gentlemen, again; you were going to tell me, sir,
      something more of my eldest son; and how I was led away from the subject,
      I don't know; but I meant only to have assured you that his memory was
      dear to me, till I was so tormented about that unfortunate affair of his
      pretended marriage, that at length I hated to hear him named; but the
      heir-at-law, at last, will triumph over me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my good sir, not if you triumph over yourself, and do justice,' cried
      Lord Colambre; 'if you listen to the truth, which my friend will tell you,
      and if you will read and believe the confirmation of it, under your son's
      own hand, in this packet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His own hand indeed! His seal unbroken. But how&#8212;when where&#8212;why
      was it kept so long, and how came it into your hands?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran told Mr. Reynolds that the packet had been given to him
      by Captain Reynolds on his deathbed; related the dying acknowledgment
      which Captain Reynolds had made of his marriage; and gave an account of
      the delivery of the packet to the ambassador, who had promised to transmit
      it faithfully. Lord Colambre told the manner in which it had been mislaid,
      and at last recovered from among the deceased ambassador's papers. The
      father still gazed at the direction, and re-examined the seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My son's handwriting&#8212;my son's seals! But where is the certificate
      of the marriage?' repeated he; 'if it is withinside of this packet, I have
      done great IN- but I am convinced it never was a marriage. 'Yet I wish now
      it could be proved&#8212;only, in that case, I have for years done great&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you open the packet, sir?' said Lord Colambre. Mr. Reynolds looked
      up at him with a look that said, 'I don't clearly know what interest you
      have in all this.' But, unable to speak, and his hands trembling so that
      he could scarcely break the seals, he tore off the cover, laid the papers
      before him, sat down, and took breath. Lord Colambre, however impatient,
      had now too much humanity to hurry the old gentleman; he only ran for the
      spectacles, which he espied on the chimney-piece, rubbed them bright, and
      held them ready. Mr. Reynolds stretched his hand out for them, put them
      on, and the first paper he opened was the certificate of the marriage; he
      read it aloud, and, putting it down, said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I acknowledge the marriage. I always said, if there is a marriage
      there must be a certificate. And you see now there is a certificate I
      acknowledge the marriage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now,' cried Lord Colambre, 'I am happy, positively happy. Acknowledge
      your grand-daughter, sir&#8212;acknowledge Miss Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Acknowledge who, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Acknowledge Miss Reynolds&#8212;your grand-daughter; I ask no more&#8212;do
      what you will with your fortune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, now I understand&#8212;I begin to understand this young gentleman is
      in love&#8212;but where is my grand-daughter?&#8212;how shall I know she
      is my grand-daughter? I have not heard of her since she was an infant&#8212;I
      forgot her existence&#8212;I have done her great injustice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She knows nothing of it, sir,' said Lord Colambre, who now entered into a
      full explanation of Miss Nugent's history, and of her connexion with his
      family, and of his own attachment to her; concluding the whole by assuring
      Mr. Reynolds that his grand-daughter had every virtue under heaven. 'And
      as to your fortune, sir, I know that she will, as I do, say&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No matter what she will say,' interrupted old Reynolds; 'where is she?
      When I see her, I shall hear what she says. Tell me where she is, let me
      see her. I long to see whether there is any likeness to her poor father.
      Where is she? Let me see her immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is one hundred and sixty miles off, sir, at Buxton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my lord, and what is a hundred and sixty miles? I suppose you think
      I can't stir from my chair, but you are mistaken. I think nothing of a
      journey of a hundred and sixty miles&#8212;I'm ready to set off to-morrow&#8212;this
      instant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre said, that he was sure Miss Reynolds would obey her
      grandfather's slightest summons, as it was her duty to do, and would be
      with him as soon as possible, if this would be more agreeable to him. 'I
      will write to her instantly,' said his lordship, 'if you will commission
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my lord, I do not commission&#8212;I will go&#8212;I think nothing, I
      say, of a journey of a hundred and sixty miles&#8212;I'll go&#8212;and set
      out to-morrow morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre and the count, perfectly satisfied with the result of their
      visit, now thought it best to leave old Reynolds at liberty to rest
      himself, after so many strong and varied feelings. They paid their parting
      compliments, settled the time for the next day's journey, and were just
      going to quit the room when Lord Colambre heard in the passage a
      well-known voice the voice of Mrs. Petito.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, my compliments, and my Lady Dashfort's best compliments, and I
      will call again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no,' cried old Reynolds, pulling his bell; 'I'll have no calling
      again&#8212;I'll be hanged if I do! Let her in now, and I'll see her&#8212;Jack!
      let in that woman now or never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady's gone, sir, out of the street door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'After her, then&#8212;now or never, tell her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sir, she was in a hackney coach.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Reynolds jumped up, and went to the window himself, and, seeing the
      hackney coachman just turning beckoned at the window, and Mrs. Petito was
      set down again, and ushered in by Jack, who announced her as&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The lady, sir.' The only lady he had seen in that house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear Mr. Reynolds, I'm so obliged to you for letting me in,' cried
      Mrs. Petito, adjusting her shawl in the passage, and speaking in a voice
      and manner well mimicked after her betters. 'You are so very good and
      kind, and I am so much obliged to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not obliged to me, and I am neither good nor kind,' said old
      Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You strange man,' said Mrs. Petito, advancing graceful in shawl drapery;
      but she stopped short. 'My Lord Colambre and Count O'Halloran, as I hope
      to be saved!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not know Mrs. Petito was an acquaintance of yours, gentlemen,' said
      Mr. Reynolds, smiling shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count O'Halloran was too polite to deny his acquaintance with a lady who
      challenged it by thus naming him; but he had not the slightest
      recollection of her, though it seems he had met her on the stairs when he
      visited Lady Dashfort at Killpatrickstown. Lord Colambre was 'indeed
      UNDENIABLY AN OLD AQUAINTANCE:' and as soon as she had recovered from her
      first natural start and vulgar exclamation, she with very easy familiarity
      hoped 'My Lady Clonbrony, and my lord, and Miss Nugent, and all her
      friends in the family, were well;' and said, 'she did not know whether she
      was to congratulate his lordship or not upon Miss Broadhurst, my Lady
      Berryl's marriage, but she should soon have to hope for his lordship's
      congratulations for another marriage in HER present family&#8212;lady
      Isabel to Colonel Heathcock, who has come in for a large portion, and they
      are buying the wedding clothes&#8212;sights of clothes&#8212;and the
      di'monds, this day; and Lady Dashfort and my Lady Isabel sent me
      especially, sir, to you, Mr. Reynolds, and to tell you, sir, before
      anybody else; and to hope the cheese COME safe up again at last; and to
      ask whether the Iceland moss agrees with your chocolate, and is palatable;
      it's the most DILUENT thing upon the universal earth, and the most TONIC
      and fashionable&#8212;the DUTCHES of Torcaster takes it always for
      breakfast, and Lady St. James' too is quite a convert, and I hear the Duke
      of V&#8212;takes it too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the devil may take it too, for anything that I care,' said old
      Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear, dear sir! you are so refractory a patient.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am no patient at all, ma'am, and have no patience either; I am as well
      as you are, or my Lady Dashfort either, and hope, God willing, long to
      continue so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petito smiled aside at Lord Colambre, to mark her perception of the
      man's strangeness. Then, in a cajoling voice, addressing herself to the
      old gentleman&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Long, long, I hope, to continue so, if Heaven grants my daily and nightly
      prayers, and my Lady Dashfort's also. So, Mr. Reynolds, if the ladies'
      prayers are of any avail, you ought to be purely, and I suppose ladies'
      prayers have the precedency in efficacy. But it was not of prayers and
      deathbed affairs I came commissioned to treat&#8212;not of burials, which
      Heaven above forbid, but of weddings my diplomacy was to speak; and to
      premise my Lady Dashfort would have come herself in her carriage, but is
      hurried out of her senses, and my Lady Isabel could not in proper modesty;
      so they sent me as their DOUBLE to hope you, my dear Mr. Reynolds, who is
      one of the family relations, will honour the wedding with your presence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be no honour, and they know that as well as I do,' said the
      intractable Mr. Reynolds. 'It will be no advantage, either; but that they
      do not know as well as I do. Mrs. Petito, to save you and your lady all
      trouble about me in future, please to let my Lady Dashfort know that I
      have just received and read the certificate of my son Captain Reynolds's
      marriage with Miss St. Omar. I have acknowledged the marriage. Better late
      than never; and to-morrow morning, God willing, shall set out with this
      young nobleman for Buxton, where I hope to see, and intend publicly to
      acknowledge, my grand-daughter&#8212;provided she will acknowledge me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'CRIMINI!' exclaimed Mrs. Petito, 'what new turns are here! Well, sir, I
      shall tell my lady of the METAMORPHOSES that have taken place, though by
      what magic (as I have not the honour to deal in the black art) I can't
      guess. But, since it seems annoying and inopportune, I shall take my
      FINALE, and shall thus have a verbal P.P.C.&#8212;as you are leaving town,
      it seems, for Buxton so early in the morning. My Lord Colambre, if I see
      rightly into a millstone, as I hope and believe I do on the present
      occasion, I have to congratulate your lordship (haven't I?) upon something
      like a succession, or a windfall, in this DENEWMENT. And I beg you'll make
      my humble respects acceptable to the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was;
      and I won't DERROGATE her by any other name in the interregnum, as I am
      persuaded it will only be a temporary name, scarce worth assuming, except
      for the honour of the public adoption; and that will, I'm confident, be
      soon exchanged for a viscount's title, or I have no sagacity nor sympathy.
      I hope I don't (pray don't let me) put you to the blush, my lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre would not have let her, if he could have helped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Count O'Halloran, your most obedient! I had the honour of meeting you at
      Killpatrickstown,' said Mrs. Petito, backing to the door, and twitching
      her shawl. She stumbled, nearly fell down, over the large dog&#8212;caught
      by the door, and recovered herself. Hannibal rose and shook his ears.
      'Poor fellow! you are of my acquaintance too.' She would have stroked his
      head; but Hannibal walked off indignant, and so did she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended certain hopes; for Mrs. Petito had conceived that her DIPLOMACY
      might be turned to account; that in her character of an ambassadress, as
      Lady Dashfort's double, by the aid of Iceland moss in chocolate, flattery
      properly administered; that, by bearing with all her DEAR Mr. Reynolds's
      ODDNESSES and ROUGHNESES, she might in time&#8212;that is to say, before
      he made a new will become his dear Mrs. Petito; or (for stranger things
      have happened and do happen every day) his dear Mrs. Reynolds! Mrs.
      Petito, however, was good at a retreat; and she flattered herself that at
      least nothing of this underplot had appeared; and at all events she
      secured by her services in this embassy, the long-looked-for object of her
      ambition, Lady Dashfort's scarlet velvet gown&#8212;'not yet a thread the
      worse for the wear!' One cordial look at this comforted her for the loss
      of her expected OCTOGENAIRE; and she proceeded to discomfit her lady, by
      repeating the message with which strange old Mr. Reynolds had charged her.
      So ended all Lady Dashfort's hopes of his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the death of his youngest son, she had been indefatigable in her
      attentions, and sanguine in her hopes; the disappointment affected both
      her interest and her pride, as an INTRIGANTE. It was necessary, however,
      to keep her feelings to herself; for if Heathcock should hear anything of
      the matter before the articles were signed, he might 'be off!'&#8212;so
      she put him and Lady Isabel into her coach directly&#8212;drove to Gray's,
      to make sure at all events of the jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Count O'Halloran and Lord Colambre, delighted with the
      result of their visit, took leave of Mr. Reynolds, after having arranged
      the journey, and appointed the hour for setting off the next day. Lord
      Colambre proposed to call upon Mr. Reynolds in the evening, and introduce
      his father, Lord Clonbrony; but Mr. Reynolds said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no! I'm not ceremonious. I have given you proofs enough of that, I
      think, in the short time we've been already acquainted. Time enough to
      introduce your father to me when we are in a carriage, going our journey;
      then we can talk, and get acquainted; but merely to come this evening in a
      hurry, and say, "Lord Clonbrony, Mr. Reynolds;&#8212;Mr. Reynolds, Lord
      Clonbrony," and then bob our two heads at one another, and scrape one foot
      back, and away!&#8212;where's the use of that nonsense at my time of life,
      or at any time of life? No, no! we have enough to do without that, I
      daresay.&#8212;Good morning to you, Count O'Halloran! I thank you
      heartily. From the first moment I saw you, I liked you; lucky too that you
      brought your dog with you! 'Twas Hannibal made me first let you in; I saw
      him over the top of the blind.&#8212;Hannibal, my good fellow! I'm more
      obliged to you than you can guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So are we all,' said Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal was well patted, and then they parted. In returning home they met
      Sir James Brooke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you,' said Sir James, 'I should be in London almost as soon as
      you. Have you found old Reynolds!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just come from him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How does your business prosper! I hope as well as mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A history of all that had passed up to the present moment was given, and
      hearty congratulations received.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are you going now, Sir James?&#8212;cannot you come with us?' said
      Lord Colambre and the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Impossible,' replied Sir James;&#8212;'but, perhaps, you can come with me&#8212;I'm
      going to Gray's, to give some old family diamonds, either to be new set or
      exchanged. Count O'Halloran, I know you are a judge of these things; pray,
      come and give me your opinion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better consult your bride elect!' said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; she knows little of the matter&#8212;and cares less,' replied Sir
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not so this bride elect, or I mistake her much,' said the count, as they
      passed by the window and saw Lady Isabel, who, with Lady Dashfort, had
      been holding consultation deep with the jeweller; and Heathcock, playing
      PERSONNAGE MUET.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Dashfort, who had always, as old Reynolds expressed it, 'her head
      upon her shoulders'&#8212;presence of mind where her interests were
      concerned&#8212;ran to the door before the count and Lord Colambre could
      enter, giving a hand to each&#8212;as if they had all parted the best
      friends in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do? how do?&#8212;Give you joy! give me joy! and all that. But mind!
      not a word,' said she, laying her finger upon her lips&#8212;'not a word
      before Heathcock of old Reynolds, or of the best part of the old fool,&#8212;his
      fortune!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen bowed, in sign of submission to her ladyship's commands; and
      comprehended that she feared Heathcock might be OFF, if the best part of
      his bride (her fortune, or her EXPECTATIONS) were lowered in value or in
      prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How low is she reduced,' whispered Lord Colambre, 'when such a husband is
      thought a prize&#8212;and to be secured by a manoeuvre!' He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Spare that generous sigh!' said Sir James Brooke; 'it is wasted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel, as they approached, turned from a mirror, at which she was
      trying on a diamond crescent. Her face clouded at sight of Count
      O'Halloran and Lord Colambre, and grew dark as hatred when she saw Sir
      James Brooke. She walked away to the farther end of the shop, and asked
      one of the shopmen the price of a diamond necklace which lay upon the
      counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man said, 'He really did not know; it belonged to Lady Oranmore; it
      had just been new set for one of her ladyship's daughters, who is going to
      be married to Sir James Brooke&#8212;one of the gentlemen, my lady, who
      are just come in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, calling to his master, he asked him the price of the necklace; he
      named the value, which was considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I really thought Lady Oranmore and her daughters were vastly too
      philosophical to think of diamonds,' said Lady Isabel to her mother, with
      a sort of sentimental sneer in her voice and countenance. 'But it is some
      comfort to me to find, in these pattern-women, philosophy and love do not
      so wholly engross the heart, that they "feel every vanity in fondness
      lost."'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twould be difficult, in some cases,' thought many present.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon honour, di'monds are cursed expensive things, I know!' said
      Heathcock. 'But, be that as it may,' whispered he to the lady, though loud
      enough to be heard by others, 'I've laid a damned round wager, that no
      woman's diamonds married this winter, under a countess, in Lon'on, shall
      eclipse Lady Isabel Heathcock's!&#8212;and Mr. Gray here's to be judge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Isabel paid for this promise one of her sweetest smiles; with one of
      those smiles which she had formerly bestowed upon Lord Colambre, and which
      he had once fancied expressed so much sensibility&#8212;such
      discriminative and delicate application. Our hero felt so much contempt,
      that he never wasted another sigh of pity for her degradation. Lady
      Dashfort came up to him as he was standing alone; and, whilst the count
      and Sir James were settling about the diamonds&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord Colambre,' said she, in a low voice, 'I know your thoughts, and I
      could moralise as well as you, if I did not prefer laughing&#8212;you are
      right enough; and so am I, and so is Isabel; we are all right. For look
      here: women have not always the liberty of choice, and therefore they
      can't be expected to have always the power of refusal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, satisfied with her convenient optimism, got into her carriage
      with her daughter, her daughter's diamonds, and her precious son-in-law,
      her daughter's companion for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The more I see,' said Count O'Halloran to Lord Colambre, as they left the
      shop, 'the more I find reason to congratulate you upon your escape, my
      dear lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I owe it not to my own wit or wisdom,' said Lord Colambre; 'but much to
      love, and much to friendship,' added he, turning to Sir James Brooke;
      'here was the friend who early warned me against the siren's voice; who,
      before I knew Lady Isabel, told me what I have since found to be true,
      that,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     'Two passions alternately govern her fate&#8212;<br />      Her business is love, but her pleasure is hate.'<br /></pre>
    <p>
      'That is dreadfully severe, Sir James,' said Count O'Halloran; 'but I am
      afraid it is just.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure it is just, or I would not have said it,' replied Sir James
      Brooke. 'For the foibles of the sex, I hope, I have as much indulgence as
      any man, and for the errors of passion as much pity; but I cannot repress
      the indignation, the abhorrence I feel against women, cold and vain, who
      use their wit and their charms only to make others miserable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre recollected at this moment Lady Isabel's look and voice,
      when she declared that 'she would let her little finger be cut off to
      purchase the pleasure of inflicting on Lady de Cresey, for one hour, the
      torture of jealousy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps,' continued Sir James Brooke, 'now that I am going to marry into
      an Irish family, I may feel, with peculiar energy, disapprobation of this
      mother and daughter on another account; but you, Lord Colambre, will do me
      the justice to recollect that, before I had any personal interest in the
      country, I expressed, as a general friend to Ireland, antipathy to those
      who return the hospitality they received from a warm-hearted people, by
      publicly setting the example of elegant sentimental hypocrisy, or daring
      disregard of decorum, by privately endeavouring to destroy the domestic
      peace of families, on which, at last, public as well as private virtue and
      happiness depend. I do rejoice, my dear Lord Colambre, to hear you say
      that I had any share in saving you from the siren; and now, I will never
      speak of these ladies more. I am sorry you cannot stay in town to see&#8212;but
      why should I be sorry&#8212;we shall meet again, I trust, and I shall
      introduce you; and you, I hope, will introduce me to a very different
      charmer. Farewell!&#8212;you have my warm good wishes wherever you go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James turned off quickly to the street in which Lady Oranmore lived,
      and Lord Colambre had not time to tell him that he knew and admired his
      intended bride. Count O'Halloran promised to do this for him. 'And now,'
      said the good count, 'I am to take leave of you; and I assure you I do it
      with so much reluctance that nothing less than positive engagements to
      stay in town would prevent me from setting off with you to-morrow; but I
      shall be soon, very soon, at liberty to return to Ireland; and Clonbrony
      Castle, if you will give me leave, I will see before I see Halloran
      Castle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre joyfully thanked his friend for this promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nay, it is to indulge myself. I long to see you happy&#8212;long to
      behold the choice of such a heart as yours. Pray do not steal a march upon
      me&#8212;let me know in time. I will leave everything&#8212;even the siege
      of&#8212;for your wedding. But I trust I shall be in time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Assuredly you will, my dear count; if ever that wedding&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'IF,' repeated the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      'IF,' repeated Lord Colambre. 'Obstacles which, when we last parted,
      appeared to me invincible, prevented my having ever even attempted to make
      an impression on the heart of the woman I love; and if you knew her,
      count, as well as I do, you would know that her love could "not unsought
      be won."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of that I cannot doubt, or she would not be your choice; but when her
      love is sought, we have every reason to hope,' said the count, smiling,
      'that it may, because it ought to be won by tried honour and affection. I
      only require to be left in hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I leave you hope,' said Lord Colambre; 'Miss Nugent&#8212;Miss
      Reynolds, I should say, has been in the habit of considering a union with
      me as impossible; my mother early instilled this idea into her mind. Miss
      Nugent thought that duty forbad her to think of me; she told me so: I have
      seen it in all her conduct and manners. The barriers of habit, the ideas
      of duty, cannot, ought not, to be thrown down or suddenly changed in a
      well-regulated female mind. And you, I am sure, know enough of the best
      female hearts, to be aware that time&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, let this dear good charmer take her own time, provided
      there's none given to affectation, or prudery, or coquetry; and from all
      these, of course, she must be free; and of course I must be content. ADIEU
      AU REVOIR.'

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Lord Colambre was returning home, he was overtaken by Sir Terence
      O'Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my lord,' cried Sir Terence, out of breath, 'you have led me a
      pretty dance all over the town; here's a letter somewhere down in my safe
      pocket for you, which has cost me trouble enough. Phoo! where is it now?&#8212;it's
      from Miss Nugent,' said he, holding up the letter. The direction to
      Grosvenor Square, London, had been scratched out; and it had been
      re-directed by Sir Terence to the Lord Viscount Colambre, at Sir James
      Brooke's, Bart., Brookwood, Huntingdonshire, or elsewhere, with speed.
      'But the more haste the worse speed; for away it went to Brookwood,
      Huntingdonshire, where I knew, if anywhere, you was to be found; but, as
      fate and the post would have it, there the letter went coursing after you,
      while you were running round, and back and forwards, and everywhere, I
      understand, to Toddrington and Wrestham, and where not, through all them
      English places, where there's no cross-post; so I took it for granted that
      it found its way to the dead-letter office, or was sticking up across a
      pane in the d&#8212;d postmaster's window at Huntingdon, for the whole
      town to see, and it a love-letter, and some puppy to claim it, under false
      pretence; and you all the time without it, and it might breed a coolness
      betwixt you and Miss Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Sir Terence, give me the letter now you have me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear lord, if you knew what a race I have had, missing you here by
      five minutes, and there by five seconds&#8212;but I have you at last, and
      you have it&#8212;and I'm paid this minute for all I liquidated of my
      substance, by the pleasure I have in seeing you crack the seal and read
      it. But take care you don't tumble over the orange woman&#8212;orange
      barrows are a great nuisance, when one's studying a letter in the streets
      of London, or the metropolis. But never heed; stick to my arm, and I'll
      guide you, like a blind man, safe through the thick of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nugent's letter, which Lord Colambre read in spite of the jostling of
      passengers, and the incessant talking of Sir Terence, was as follows:&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me not be the cause of banishing you from your home and your country,
      where you would do so much good, and make so many happy. Let me not be the
      cause of your breaking your promise to your mother; of your disappointing
      my dear aunt, so cruelly, who has complied with all our wishes, and who
      sacrifices, to oblige us, her favourite tastes. How could she ever be
      happy in Ireland&#8212;how could Clonbrony Castle be a home to her,
      without her son? if you take away all she had of amusement and PLEASURE,
      as it is called, are not you bound to give her, in their stead, that
      domestic happiness, which she can enjoy only with you, and by your means?
      If, instead of living with her, you go into the army, she will be in
      daily, nightly anxiety and alarm about you; and her son will, instead of
      being a comfort, be a source of torment to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will hope that you will do now, as you have always hitherto done, on
      every occasion where I have seen you act, what is right, and just, and
      kind. Come here on the day you promised my aunt you would; before that
      time I shall be in Cambridgeshire, with my friend Lady Berryl; she is so
      good as to come to Buxton for me&#8212;I shall remain with her, instead of
      returning to Ireland. I have explained my reasons to my dear aunt&#8212;Could
      I have any concealment from her, to whom, from my earliest childhood, I
      owe everything that kindness and affection could give? She is satisfied&#8212;she
      consents to my living henceforward with Lady Berryl. Let me have the
      pleasure of seeing, by your conduct, that you approve of mine.&#8212;Your
      affectionate cousin and friend, GRACE NUGENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, as may be imagined by those who, like him, are capable of
      feeling honourable and generous conduct, gave our hero exquisite pleasure.
      Poor, good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay enjoyed his lordship's delight; and
      forgot himself so completely, that he never even inquired whether Lord
      Colambre had thought of an affair on which he had spoken to him some time
      before, and which materially concerned Sir Terence's interest. The next
      morning, when the carriage was at the door, and Sir Terence was just
      taking leave of his friend Lord Clonbrony, and actually in tears, wishing
      them all manner of happiness, though he said there was none left now in
      London, or the wide world, even, for him&#8212;Lord Colambre went up to
      him, and said, 'Sir Terence, you have never inquired whether I have done
      your business?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear, I'm not thinking of that now&#8212;time enough by the post&#8212;I
      can write after you; but my thoughts won't turn for me to business now no
      matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your business is done,' replied Lord Colambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I wonder how you could think of it, with all you had upon your mind
      and heart. When anything's upon my heart, good morning to my head, it's
      not worth a lemon. Good-bye to you, and thank you kindly, and all
      happiness attend you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye to you, Sir Terence O'Fay,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'and, since
      it's so ordered, I must live without you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! you'll live better without me! my lord; I am not a good liver, I
      know, nor the best of all companions for a nobleman, young or old; and now
      you'll be rich, and not put to your shifts and your wits, what would I
      have to do for you?&#8212;Sir Terence O'Fay, you know, was only THE POOR
      NOBLEMAN'S FRIEND, and you'll never want to call upon him again, thanks to
      your jewel, your Pitt's-di'mond of a son there. So we part here, and
      depend upon it you're better without me&#8212;that's all my comfort, or my
      heart would break. The carriage is waiting this long time, and this young
      lover's itching to be off. God bless you both!&#8212;that's my last word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They called in Red Lion Square, punctual to the moment, on old Mr.
      Reynolds, but his window-shutters were shut; he had been seized in the
      night with a violent fit of the gout, which, as he said, held him fast by
      the leg. 'But here,' said he, giving Lord Colambre a letter, 'here's what
      will do your business without me. Take this written acknowledgment I have
      penned for you, and give my grand-daughter her father's letter to read&#8212;it
      would touch a heart of stone&#8212;touched mine&#8212;wish I could drag
      the mother back out of her grave, to do her justice&#8212;all one now. You
      see at last I'm not a suspicious rascal, however, for I don't suspect you
      of palming a false grand-daughter upon me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you,' said Lord Colambre, 'give your grand-daughter leave to come up
      to town to you, sir? You would satisfy yourself, at least, as to what
      resemblance she may bear to her father; Miss Reynolds will come instantly,
      and she will nurse you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; I won't have her come. If she comes, I won't see her&#8212;shan't
      begin by nursing me&#8212;not selfish. As soon as I get rid of this gout,
      I shall be my own man, and young again, and I'll soon be after you across
      the sea, that shan't stop me; I'll come to&#8212;what's the name of your
      place in Ireland? and see what likeness I can find to her poor father in
      this grand-daughter of mine, that you puffed so finely yesterday. And let
      me see whether she will wheedle me as finely as Mrs. Petito would. Don't
      get ready your marriage settlements, do you hear, till you have seen my
      will, which I shall sign at&#8212;what's the name of your place? Write it
      down there; there's pen and ink; and leave me, for the twinge is coming,
      and I shall roar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you permit me, sir, to leave my own servant with you to take care of
      you? I can answer for his attention and fidelity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me see his face, and I'll tell you.' Lord Colambre's servant was
      summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I like his face. God bless you!&#8212;Leave me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre gave his servant a charge to bear with Mr. Reynolds's rough
      manner and temper, and to pay the poor old gentleman every possible
      attention. Then our hero proceeded with his father on his journey, and on
      this journey nothing happened worthy of note. On his first perusal of the
      letter from Grace, Lord Colambre had feared that she would have left
      Buxton with Lady Berryl before he could reach it; but, upon recollection,
      he hoped that the few lines he had written, addressed to his mother AND
      Miss Nugent, with the assurance that he should be with them on Wednesday,
      would be sufficient to show her that some great change had happened, and
      consequently sufficient to prevent her from quitting her aunt, till she
      could know whether such a separation would be necessary. He argued wisely,
      more wisely than Grace had reasoned; for, notwithstanding this note, she
      would have left Buxton before his arrival, but for Lady Berryl's strength
      of mind, and positive determination not to set out with her till Lord
      Colambre should arrive to explain. In the interval, poor Grace was,
      indeed, in an anxious state of suspense; and her uncertainty, whether she
      was doing right or wrong, by staying to see Lord Colambre, tormented her
      most.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, you cannot help yourself; be quiet,' said Lady Berryl; 'I will
      take the whole upon my conscience; and I hope my conscience may never have
      anything worse to answer for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace was the first person who, from her window, saw Lord Colambre, the
      instant the carriage drove to the door. She ran to her friend Lady
      Berryl's apartment&#8212;'He is come!&#8212;Now, take me away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not yet, my sweet friend! Lie down upon this sofa, if you please; and
      keep yourself tranquil, whilst I go and see what you ought to do; and
      depend upon me for a true friend, in whose mind, as in your own, duty is
      the first object.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I depend on you entirely,' said Grace, sinking down on the sofa; 'and you
      see I obey you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Many thanks to you for lying down, when you can't stand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Berryl went to Lady Clonbrony's apartment; she was met by Sir Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, my love! come quick!&#8212;Lord Colambre is arrived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it; and does he go to Ireland? Speak instantly, that I may tell
      Grace Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can tell her nothing yet, my love; for we know nothing. Lord Colambre
      will not say a word till you come; but I know, by his countenance, that he
      has good and extraordinary news.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed rapidly along the passage to Lady Clonbrony's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, my dear, dear Lady Berryl, come! or I shall die with impatience,'
      cried Lady Clonbrony, in a voice and manner between laughing and crying.
      'There, now you have congratulated, are very happy, and very glad, and all
      that&#8212;now, for mercy's sake, sit down, Lord Clonbrony! for Heaven's
      sake, sit down&#8212;beside me here&#8212;or anywhere! Now, Colambre,
      begin; and tell us all at once!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But as nothing is so tedious as a twice-told tale, Lord Colambre's
      narrative need not here be repeated. He began with Count O'Halloran's
      visit, immediately after Lady Clonbrony had left London; and went through
      the history of the discovery that Captain Reynolds was the husband of Miss
      St. Omar, and the father of Grace; the dying acknowledgment of his
      marriage; the packet delivered by Count O'Halloran to the careless
      ambassador&#8212;how recovered, by the assistance of his executor, Sir
      James Brooke; the travels from Wrestham to Toddrington, and thence to Red
      Lion Square; the interview with old Reynolds, and its final result; all
      was related as succinctly as the impatient curiosity of Lord Colambre's
      auditors could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, wonder upon wonder! and joy upon joy!' cried Lady Clonbrony. 'So my
      darling Grace is as legitimate as I am, and an heiress after all. Where is
      she? where is she? In your room, Lady Berryl?&#8212;Oh, Colambre! why
      wouldn't you let her be by?&#8212;Lady Berryl, do you know, he would not
      let me send for her, though she was the person of all others most
      concerned!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For that very reason, ma'am; and that Lord Colambre was quite right, I am
      sure you must be sensible, when you recollect, that Grace has no idea that
      she is not the daughter of Mr. Nugent; she has no suspicion that the
      breath of blame ever lighted upon her mother. This part of the story
      cannot be announced to her with too much caution; and, indeed, her mind
      has been so much harassed and agitated, and she is at present so far from
      strong, that great delicacy&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True! very true, Lady Berryl,' interrupted Lady Clonbrony; 'and I'll be
      as delicate as you please about it afterwards; but, in the first and
      foremost place, I must tell her the best part of the story&#8212;that
      she's an heiress, madam, never killed anybody!' So, darting through all
      opposition, Lady Clonbrony made her way into the room where Grace was
      lying&#8212;'Yes, get up! get up! my own Grace, and be surprised&#8212;well
      you may!&#8212;you are an heiress, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I, my dear aunt?' said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, as I'm Lady Clonbrony&#8212;and a very great heiress&#8212;and no
      more Colambre's cousin than Lady Berryl here. So now begin and love him as
      fast as you please&#8212;I give my consent&#8212;and here he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Clonbrony turned to her son, who just appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, mother! what have you done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What have I done?' cried Lady Clonbrony, following her son's eyes:&#8212;'Lord
      bless me!&#8212;Grace fainted dead&#8212;lady Berryl? Oh, what have I
      done? My dear Lady Berryl, what shall we do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There! her colour's coming again,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'come away, my
      dear Lady Clonbrony, for the present, and so will I&#8212;though I long to
      talk to the darling girl myself; but she is not equal to it yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Grace came to herself, she first saw Lady Berryl leaning over her,
      and, raising herself a little, she said&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has happened?&#8212;I don't know yet&#8212;I don't know whether I am
      happy or not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing Lord Colambre, she sat quite upright. 'You received my letter,
      cousin, I hope?&#8212;Do you go to Ireland with my aunt?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and with you, I hope, my beloved friend,' said Colambre; 'you once
      assured me that I had such a share of your esteem and affection, that the
      idea of my accompanying you to Ireland was not disagreeable to you; you
      flattered me that I formed part of your agreeable associations with home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&#8212;sit down by me, won't you, my dear Lady Berryl&#8212;but then I
      considered you as my cousin, Lord Colambre, and I thought you felt the
      same towards me; but now&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But now, my charming Grace,' said Lord Colambre, kneeling beside her, and
      taking her hand, 'no invincible obstacle opposes my passion&#8212;no
      INVINCIBLE obstacle, did I say? let me hope that I may say no obstacle,
      but what depends on the change in the nature of your sentiments. You heard
      my mother's consent; you saw her joy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I scarcely knew what I heard or saw,' said Grace, blushing deeply, 'or
      what I now see and hear; but of this I feel secure, before I comprehend
      the mystery, before you explain to me the causes of your&#8212;change of
      conduct, that you have never been actuated by caprice, but governed by
      wise and honourable motives. As to my going to Ireland, or remaining with
      Lady Berryl, she has heard all the circumstances&#8212;she is my friend
      and yours&#8212;a better friend cannot be; to her I appeal&#8212;she will
      decide for me what I OUGHT to do; she promised to take me from hence
      instantly, if I ought to go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did; and I would do so without hesitation, if any duty or any prudence
      required it. But, after having heard all the circumstances, I can only
      tell you that I willingly resign the pleasure of your company.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But tell her, my dear Lady Berryl,' said Lord Colambre, 'excellent friend
      as you are&#8212;explain to her you can, better than any of us, all that
      is to be known; let her know my whole conduct, and then let her decide for
      herself, and I shall submit to her decision. It is difficult, my dear
      Grace, to restrain the expression of love, of passion, such as I feel; but
      I have some power over myself&#8212;you know it&#8212;and this I can
      promise you, that your affections shall be free as air&#8212;that: no
      wishes of friends, no interference, nothing but your own unbiassed choice
      will I allow, if my life depended upon it, to operate in my favour. Be
      assured, my dearest Grace,' added he, smiling as he retired, 'you shall
      have time to know whether you are happy or not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had left the room, she threw herself into the arms of her
      friend, and her heart, oppressed with various feelings, was relieved by
      tears&#8212;a species of relief to which she was not habituated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am happy,' said she; 'but what was the INVINCIBLE OBSTACLE?&#8212;what
      was the meaning of my aunt's words?&#8212;and what was the cause of her
      joy? Explain all this to me, my dear friend; for I am still as if I were
      in a dream.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the delicacy which Lady Clonbrony deemed superfluous Lady Berryl
      explained. Nothing could surpass the astonishment of Grace, on first
      learning that Mr. Nugent was not her father. When she was told of the
      stigma that had been cast on her birth; the suspicions, the disgrace, to
      which her mother had been subjected for so many years&#8212;that mother,
      whom she had so loved and respected; who had, with such care, instilled
      into the mind of her daughter the principles of virtue and religion; that
      mother whom Grace had always seen the example of every virtue she taught;
      on whom her daughter never suspected that the touch of blame, the breath
      of scandal, could rest&#8212;Grace could express her sensations only by
      repeating, in tones of astonishment, pathos, indignation&#8212;'My mother!&#8212;my
      mother!&#8212;my mother!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time she was incapable of attending to any other idea, or of
      feeling any other sensations. When her mind was able to admit the thought,
      her friend soothed her, by recalling the expressions of Lord Colambre's
      love&#8212;the struggle by which he had been agitated, when he fancied a
      union with her opposed by an invincible obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace sighed, and acknowledged that, in prudence, it ought to have been an
      INVINCIBLE obstacle&#8212;she admired the firmness of his decision, the
      honour with which he had acted towards her. One moment she exclaimed,
      'Then, if I had been the daughter of a mother who had conducted herself
      ill, he never would have trusted me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she recollected, with pleasure, the joy she had just seen
      in his eyes&#8212;the affection, the passion, that spoke in every word and
      look; then dwelt upon the sober certainty, that all obstacles were
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And no duty opposes my loving him! And my aunt wishes it! my kind aunt!
      And I may think of him.&#8212;You, my best friend, would not assure me of
      this if you were not certain of the truth.&#8212;Oh, how can I thank you
      for all your kindness, and for that best of all kindness, sympathy. You
      see, your calmness, your strength of mind supports and tranquillises me. I
      would rather have heard all I have just learnt from you than from any
      other person living. I could not have borne it from any one else. No one
      else knows my mind so perfectly&#8212;yet my aunt is very good,&#8212;and
      my dear uncle! should not I go to him?&#8212;But he is not my uncle, she
      is not my aunt. I cannot bring myself to think that they are not my
      relations, and that I am nothing to them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may be everything to them, my dear Grace,' said Lady Berryl;
      'whenever you please, you may be their daughter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace blushed, and smiled, and sighed, and was consoled. But then she
      recollected her new relation. Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had
      never seen, who had for years disowned her&#8212;treated her mother with
      injustice. She could scarcely think of him with complaisancy; yet, when
      his age, his sufferings, his desolate state, were represented, she pitied
      him; and, faithful to her strong sense of duty, would have gone instantly
      to offer him every assistance and attention in her power. Lady Berryl
      assured her that Mr. Reynolds had positively forbidden her going to him;
      and that he had assured Lord Colambre he would not see her if she went to
      him. After such rapid and varied emotions, poor Grace desired repose, and
      her friend took care that it should be secured to her for the remainder of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Lord Clonbrony had kindly and judiciously employed his
      lady in a discussion about certain velvet furniture, which Grace had
      painted for the drawing-room at Clonbrony Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lady Clonbrony's mind, as in some bad paintings, there was no KEEPING;
      all objects, great and small, were upon the same level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment her son entered the room, her ladyship exclaimed&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everything pleasant at once! Here's your father tells me, Grace's velvet
      furniture's all packed; really, Soho's the best man in the world of his
      kind, and the cleverest&#8212;and so, after all, my dear Colambre, as I
      always hoped and prophesied, at last you will marry an heiress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Terry,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'will win his wager from Mordicai.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Terry!' repeated Lady Clonbrony, 'that odious Terry!&#8212;I hope, my
      lord, that he is not to be one of my comforts in Ireland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, my dear mother; he is much better provided for than we could have
      expected. One of my father's first objects was to prevent him from being
      any encumbrance to you. We consulted him as to the means of making him
      happy; and the knight acknowledged that he had long been casting a sheep's
      eye at a little snug place, that will soon be open, in his native country&#8212;the
      chair of assistant barrister at the sessions. "Assistant barrister!" said
      my father; "but, my dear Terry, you have all your life been evading the
      laws, and very frequently breaking the peace; do you think this has
      qualified you peculiarly for being a guardian of the laws?" Sir Terence
      replied, "Yes, sure; set a thief to catch a thief is no bad maxim. And did
      not Mr. Colquhoun, the Scotchman, get himself made a great justice, by his
      making all the world as wise as himself, about thieves of all sorts, by
      land and by water, and in the air too, where he detected the mud-larks?&#8212;And
      is not Barrington chief-justice of Botany Bay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father now began to be seriously alarmed, lest Sir Terence should
      insist upon his using his interest to make him an assistant barrister. He
      was not aware that five years' practice at the bar was a necessary
      accomplishment for this office; when, fortunately for all parties, my good
      friend, Count O'Halloran, helped us out of the difficulty, by starting an
      idea full of practical justice. A literary friend of the count's had been
      for some time promised a lucrative situation under Government; but,
      unfortunately, he was a man of so much merit and ability, that they could
      not find employment for him at home, and they gave him a commission, I
      should rather say a contract, abroad, for supplying the army with
      Hungarian horses. Now the gentleman had not the slightest skill in
      horseflesh; and, as Sir Terence is a complete jockey, the count observed
      that he would be the best possible deputy for his literary friend. We
      warranted him to be a thoroughgoing friend; and I do think the coalition
      will be well for both parties. The count has settled it all, and I left
      Sir Terence comfortably provided for, out of your way, my dear mother, and
      as happy as he could be, when parting from my father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Colambre was assiduous in engaging his mother's attention upon any
      subject which could for the present draw her thoughts away from her young
      friend; but, at every pause in the conversation, her ladyship repeated,
      'So Grace is an heiress, after all&#8212;so, after all, they know they are
      not cousins! Well! I prefer Grace, a thousand times over, to any other
      heiress in England. No obstacle, no objection. They have my consent. I
      always prophesied Colambre would marry an heiress; but why not marry
      directly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ardour and impatience to hurry things forward seemed now likely to
      retard the accomplishment of her own wishes; and Lord Clonbrony, who
      understood rather more of the passion of love than his lady ever had felt
      or understood, saw the agony into which she threw her son, and felt for
      his darling Grace. With a degree of delicacy and address of which few
      would have supposed Lord Clonbrony capable, his lordship co-operated with
      his son in endeavours to keep Lady Clonbrony quiet, and to suppress the
      hourly thanksgivings of Grace's TURNING OUT AN HEIRESS. On one point,
      however, she vowed she would not be overruled&#8212;she would have a
      splendid wedding at Clonbrony Castle, such as should become an heir and
      heiress; and the wedding, she hoped, would be immediately on their return
      to Ireland; she should announce the thing to her friends directly on her
      arrival at Clonbrony Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'we must wait, in the first place, the
      pleasure of old Mr. Reynolds's fit of the gout.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, that's true, because of his will,' said her ladyship; 'but a will's
      soon made, is not it? That can't be much delay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then there must be settlements,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'they take
      time. Lovers, like all the rest of mankind, must submit to the law's
      delay. In the meantime, my dear, as these Buxton baths agree with you so
      well, and as Grace does not seem to be over and above strong for
      travelling a long journey, and as there are many curious and beautiful
      scenes of nature here in Derbyshire&#8212;Matlock, and the wonders of the
      Peak, and so on&#8212;which the young people would be glad to see
      together, and may not have another opportunity soon&#8212;why not rest
      ourselves a little? For another reason, too,' continued his lordship,
      bringing together as many arguments as he could&#8212;for he had often
      found, that though Lady Clonbrony was a match for any single argument, her
      understanding could be easily overpowered by a number, of whatever sort&#8212;'besides,
      my dear, here's Sir Arthur and Lady Berryl come to Buxton on purpose to
      meet us; and we owe them some compliment, and something more than
      compliment, I think; so I don't see why we should be in a hurry to leave
      them, or quit Buxton&#8212;a few weeks sooner or later can't signify&#8212;and
      Clonbrony Castle will be getting all the while into better order for us.
      Burke is gone down there; and if we stay here quietly, there will be time
      for the velvet furniture to get there before us, and to be unpacked, and
      up in the drawing-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true, my lord,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'and there is a great deal of
      reason in all you say&#8212;so I second that motion, as Colambre, I see,
      subscribes to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed some time in Derbyshire, and every day Lord Clonbrony proposed
      some pleasant excursion, and contrived that the young people should be
      left to themselves, as Mrs. Broadhurst used so strenuously to advise; the
      recollection of whose authoritative maxims fortunately still operated upon
      Lady Clonbrony, to the great ease and advantage of the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy as a lover, a friend, a son; happy in the consciousness of having
      restored a father to respectability, and persuaded a mother to quit the
      feverish joys of fashion for the pleasures of domestic life; happy in the
      hope of winning the whole heart of the woman he loved, and whose esteem,
      he knew, he possessed and deserved; happy in developing every day, every
      hour, fresh charm in his destined bride&#8212;we leave our hero, returning
      to his native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we leave him with the reasonable expectation that he will support
      through life the promise of his early character; that his patriotic views
      will extend with his power to carry wishes into action; that his
      attachment to his warm-hearted countrymen will still increase upon further
      acquaintance; and that he will long diffuse happiness through the wide
      circle, which is peculiarly subject to the influence and example of a
      great resident Irish proprietor.

      LETTER FROM LARRY TO HIS BROTHER, PAT BRADY, AT MR. MORDICAI'S,
      COACHMAKER, LONDON.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR BROTHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours of the 26th, inclosing the five pound note for my father, came safe
      to hand Monday last; and with his thanks and blessing to you, he commends
      it to you herewith inclosed back again, on account of his being in no
      immediate necessity, nor likelihood to want in future, as you shall hear
      forthwith; but wants you over with all speed, and the note will answer for
      travelling charges; for we can't enjoy the luck it has pleased God to give
      us without YEES: put the rest in your pocket, and read it when you've
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nick's gone, and St. Dennis along with him, to the place he come from&#8212;praise
      be to God! The ould lord has found him out in his tricks; and I helped him
      to that, through the young lord that I driv, as I informed you in my last,
      when he was a Welchman, which was the best turn ever I did, though I did
      not know it no more than Adam that time. So OULD Nick's turned out of the
      agency clean and clear; and the day after it was known, there was
      surprising great joy through the whole country; not surprising either, but
      just what you might, knowing him, rasonably expect. He (that is, old Nick
      and St. Dennis) would have been burnt that night&#8212;I MANE, in EFFIGY,
      through the town of Clonbrony, but that the new man, Mr. Burke, come down
      that day too soon to stop it, and said, 'it was not becoming to trample on
      the fallen,' or something that way, that put an end to it; and though it
      was a great disappointment to many, and to me in particular, I could not
      but like the jantleman the better for it anyhow. They say, he is a very
      good jantleman, and as unlike old Nick or the saint as can be; and takes
      no duty fowl, nor glove, nor sealing-money; nor asks duty work nor duty
      turf. Well, when I was disappointed of the EFFIGY, I comforted myself by
      making a bonfire of old Nick's big rick of duty turf, which, by great
      luck, was out in the road, away from all dwelling-house, or thatch, or
      yards, to take fire; so no danger in life or objection. And such another
      blaze! I wished you'd seed it&#8212;and all the men, women, and children
      in the town and country, far and near, gathered round it, shouting and
      dancing like mad!&#8212;and it was light as day quite across the bog, as
      far as Bartley Finnigan's house. And I heard after, they seen it from all
      parts of the three counties, and they thought it was St. John's Eve in a
      mistake&#8212;or couldn't make out what it was; but all took it in good
      part, for a good sign, and were in great joy. As for St. Dennis and OULD
      Nick, an attorney had his foot upon em, with an habere a latitat, and
      three executions hanging over 'em; and there's the end of rogues! and a
      great example in the country. And&#8212;no more about it; for I can't be
      wasting more ink upon them that don't desarve it at my hands, when I want
      it for them that do, you shall see. So some weeks past, and there was
      great cleaning at Clonbrony Castle, and in the town of Clonbrony; and the
      new agent's smart and clever; and he had the glaziers, and the painters,
      and the slaters up and down in the town wherever wanted; and you wouldn't
      know it again. Thinks I, this is no bad sign! Now, cock up your ears, Pat!
      for the great news is coming, and the good. The master's come home&#8212;long
      life to him!&#8212;and family come home yesterday, all entirely! The OULD
      lord and the young lord (ay, there's the man, Paddy!), and my lady, and
      Miss Nugent. And I driv Miss Nugent's maid, that maid that was, and
      another; so I had the luck to be in it along WID 'em, and see all, from
      first to last. And first, I must tell you, my young Lord Colambre
      remembered and noticed me the minute he lit at our inn, and condescended
      to beckon at me out of the yard to him, and axed me&#8212;'Friend Larry,'
      says he, 'did you keep your promise?'&#8212;'My oath again' the whisky, is
      it?' says I. 'My lord, I surely did,' said I; which was true, as all the
      country knows I never tasted a drop since. 'And I'm proud to see your
      honour, my lord, as good as your word too, and back again among us. So
      then there was a call for the horses; and no more at that time passed
      betwix' my young lord and me, but that he pointed me out to the OULD one,
      as I went off. I noticed and thanked him for it in my heart, though I did
      not know all the good was to come of it. Well, no more of myself, for the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ogh, it's I driv 'em well; and we all got to the great gate of the park
      before sunset, and as fine an evening as ever you see; with the sun
      shining on the tops of the trees, as the ladies noticed; the leaves
      changed, but not dropped, though so late in the season. I believe the
      leaves knew what they were about, and kept on, on purpose to welcome them;
      and the birds were singing, and I stopped whistling, that they might hear
      them; but sorrow bit could they hear when they got to the park gate, for
      there was such a crowd, and such a shout, as you never see&#8212;and they
      had the horses off every carriage entirely, and drew'em home, with,
      blessings, through the park. And, God bless 'em! when they got out, they
      didn't go shut themselves up in the great drawing-room, but went straight
      out to the TIRrass, to satisfy the eyes and hearts that followed them. My
      lady LANING on my young lord, and Miss Grace Nugent that was, the
      beautifullest angel that ever you set eyes on, with the finest complexion
      and sweetest of smiles, LANING upon the ould lord's arm, who had his hat
      off, bowing to all, and noticing the old tenants as he passed by name. Oh,
      there was great gladness and tears in the midst; for joy I could scarce
      keep from myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a turn or two upon the TIRrass, my Lord Colambre QUIT his mother's
      arm for a minute, and he come to the edge of the slope, and looked down
      and through all the crowd for some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it the widow O'Neill, my lord?' says I; 'she's yonder, with the
      spectacles on her nose, betwixt her son and daughter, as usual.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my lord beckoned, and they did not know which of the TREE would stir;
      and then he gave TREE beckons with his own finger, and they all TREE came
      fast enough to the bottom of the slope forenent my lord; and he went down
      and helped the widow up (Oh, he's the true jantleman), and brought 'em all
      TREE up on the TIRrass, to my lady and Miss Nugent; and I was up close
      after, that I might hear, which wasn't manners, but I couldn't help it. So
      what he said I don't well know, for I could not get near enough, after
      all. But I saw my lady smile very kind, and take the widow O'Neill by the
      hand, and then my Lord Colambre 'TRODUCED Grace to Miss Nugent, and there
      was the word NAMESAKE, and something about a check curtains; but, whatever
      It was, they was all greatly pleased; then my Lord Colambre turned and
      looked for Brian, who had fell back, and took him with some commendation
      to my lord his father. And my lord the master said, which I didn't know
      till after, that they should have their house and farm at the OULD rent;
      and at the surprise, the widow dropped down dead; and there was a cry as
      for ten BERRINGS. 'Be qui'te,' says I, 'she's only kilt for joy;' and I
      went and lift her up, for her son had no more strength that minute than
      the child new born; and Grace trembled like a leaf, as white as the sheet,
      but not long, for the mother came to, and was as well as ever when I
      brought some water, which Miss Nugent handed to her with her own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was always pretty and good, said the widow, laying her hand upon
      Miss Nugent, 'and kind and good to me and mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That minute there was music from below. The blind harper, O'Neill, with
      his harp, that struck up 'Gracey Nugent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And that finished, and my Lord Colambre smiling, with the tears standing
      in his eyes too, and the OULD lord quite wiping his, I ran to the TIRrass
      brink to bid O'Neill play it again; but as I run, I thought I heard a
      voice call Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who calls Larry?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord Colambre calls you, Larry,' says all at once; and four takes me
      by the shoulders and spins me round. 'There's my young lord calling you,
      Larry&#8212;run for your life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So I run back for my life, and walked respectful, with my hat in my hand,
      when I got near.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put on your hat, my father desires it, says my Lord Colambre. The ould
      lord made a sign to that purpose, but was too full to speak. 'Where's your
      father?' continues my young lord.&#8212;' He's very ould, my lord,' says
      I. 'I didn't ask you how ould he was,' says he; 'but where is he?'&#8212;'He's
      behind the crowd below, on account of his infirmities; he couldn't walk so
      fast as the rest, my lord,' says I; 'but his heart is with you, if not his
      body. 'I must have his body too, so bring him bodily before us; and this
      shall be your warrant for so doing,' said my lord, joking; for he knows
      the NATUR of us, Paddy, and how we love a joke in our hearts, as well as
      if he had lived all his life in Ireland; and by the same token will, for
      that rason, do what he pleases with us, and more maybe than a man twice as
      good, that never would smile on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I'm telling you of my father. 'I've a warrant for you, father,' says
      I; 'and must have you bodily before the justice, and my lord
      chief-justice.' So he changed colour a bit at first; but he saw me smile.
      'And I've done no sin,' said he; 'and, Larry, you may lead me now, as you
      led me all my life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And up the slope he went with me as light as fifteen; and, when we got up,
      my Lord Clonbrony said, 'I am sorry an old tenant, and a good old tenant,
      as I hear you were, should have been turned out of your farm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't fret, it's no great matter, my lord,' said my father. 'I shall be
      soon out of the way; but if you would be so kind to speak a word for my
      boy here, and that I could afford, while the life is in me, bring my other
      boy back out of banishment&#8212;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' says my Lord Clonbrony, 'I'll give you and your sons three lives,
      or thirty-one years, from this day, of your former farm. Return to it when
      you please.' 'And,' added my Lord Colambre, 'the flaggers, I hope, will be
      soon banished.' Oh, how could I thank him&#8212;not a word could I proffer&#8212;but
      I know I clasped my two hands, and prayed for him inwardly. And my father
      was dropping down on his knees, but the master would not let him; and
      OBSARVED, that posture should only be for his God. And, sure enough, in
      that posture, when he was out of sight, we did pray for him that night,
      and will all our days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, before we quit his presence, he called me back, and bid me write to
      my brother, and bring you back, if you've no objections, to your own
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      So come, my dear Pat, and make no delay, for joy's not joy complAte till
      you're in it&#8212;my father sends his blessing, and Peggy her love. The
      family entirely is to settle for good in Ireland, and there was in the
      castle yard last night a bonfire made by my lord's orders of the ould
      yellow damask furniture, to plase my lady, my lord says. And the
      drawing-room, the butler was telling me, is new hung; and the chairs with
      velvet as white as snow, and shaded over with natural flowers, by Miss
      Nugent. Oh! how I hope what I guess will come true, and I've rason to
      believe it will, for I dreamt in my bed last night it did. But keep
      yourself to yourself&#8212;that Miss Nugent (who is no more Miss Nugent,
      they say, but Miss Reynolds, and has a new-found grandfather, and is a big
      heiress, which she did not want in my eyes, nor in my young lord's), I've
      a notion will be sometime, and maybe sooner than is expected, my Lady
      Viscountess Colambre&#8212;so haste to the wedding. And there's another
      thing: they say the rich ould grandfather's coming over;&#8212;and another
      thing, Pat, you would not be out of the fashion&#8212;and you see it's
      growing the fashion not to be an Absentee.&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your loving brother,
    </p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
